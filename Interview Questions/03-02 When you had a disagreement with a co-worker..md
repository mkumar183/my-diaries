- I have had several situations where i have disagreement with my QA counterpart and also at times with my own Boss. 
- I wanted to get into break down our releases by each area. QA counterpart does not agree with it. Then i explained to them this process is not going to be implemented as of now. First, we have to instrument and set the process and create separation of concern around each component. It requires lot of deep work. We need the ability to do it. Weather we do it operationally or not is a secondary matter. Over a period of time, i am able to separate the releases for internal tools vs the product. We are now working separating releases for ETLs/Batch jobs and Portal. Its almost done however, operations wise both QA Leader and Product Leaders are not aligned. 


- Disagreement with Boss: Component Wise analysis. He was not in favor of it and had a notion that it will create silos. I decided a middle ground that we will separate out however, we will rotate and not have team ownership. It will not be hard bound. However, categorizing defects by components and doing analysis on these is a requirement. So over a period of time we continued this work and now he does not have major objection to it.
