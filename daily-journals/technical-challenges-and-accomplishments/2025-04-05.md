Situation: 
- Wanted to start with journey of building a new app using AI Tools 
- Wanted to research which tools are best. lovable/cursor and many more 
- Facing challenges working on same project both via lovable and cursor. 
- Facing major challenges wrt working with RLS on supabase 
- I wasn't sure what is the right architecture for this project 

Task:
- I wanted to ensure that for this project i can work across both lovable and cursor. 
- I wanted to finalize architecture of this project in terms of backend to be used 
- I wanted to resolve RLS issue. 

Action:
- I made the project work across both tools via github sync. 
- I went through several videos for recommendation on AI Tools 
- I tried building sample projects in some of these tools. 

Results:
- I decided to build the application scholar using Lovable.ai and Cursor.ai.
- I was able to work both on lovable as well as cursor for same project comparing how it works
- I was able to rapidly build scholar app that resides in my github today 
- I finalize architecture of using supabse as backend since its super easy, serverless and scalable 
- I am still researching how to solve RLS. but for this I am able to learn how to disable RLS, how to check server logs on supabase and how to look at developer's tab for api calls and tokens passed 
- I am able to decode jwt token and read what's been passed to APIs.
