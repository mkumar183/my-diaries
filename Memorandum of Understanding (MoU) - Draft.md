**This MoU** is made and entered into on [Date] by and among **Tejinder Ji, Naresh Ji, Pawan Ji, and Taru Ji** (hereafter collectively referred to as the **"Partners"**). The initial business location, the canteen located at **Christ College’s main campus on Dharmaram Road**, will be referred to in this document as the **"Christ Main Canteen"**.

### 1. Purpose and Shared Vision
- The Partners agree to establish, operate, and grow a food service business branded as **“Panjabi Bites”**, starting with a food court at the main campus of Christ College. The mission is to deliver high-quality food services to the college community and set a foundation for sustainable expansion, enabling professional growth and development for all Partners.

### 2. Foundational Principles
- The partnership is built on the principles of **Integrity, Accountability, Transparency, Collaboration, Fairness, and Social Equity**. Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure these values are upheld. If any Partner perceives a deviation from these values, they may bring the matter to the team’s attention, and appropriate corrective actions will be taken by mutual agreement.

### 3. Brand Use and Expansion
- The business will operate under the brand name **"Panjabi Bites"**. Any future food-related business ventures or expansions under this brand name require full disclosure and discussion among all Partners. Expansion decisions will be jointly made, with the group deciding if current partners will execute the venture or if additional shareholders will be introduced. No new ventures under the "Panjabi Bites" brand shall commence without informing and securing agreement from all partners, to ensure the brand’s unified identity and shared ownership.

### 4. Vision for Growth and Scaling
- The long-term vision of this partnership is to develop **Panjabi Bites** into a multi-million dollar enterprise, establishing it as a nationally and internationally recognized brand with the potential to become a publicly traded company with thousands of shareholders. This ambitious vision will be realized through systematic growth, brand establishment, and operational excellence.

- As the brand expands, new partners or contributors who significantly drive revenue will be offered equity through **ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans)**, stock options and equity expansion. This mechanism will evolve with the business, ensuring that the contributions of new partners align with the brand’s financial and strategic goals.

- Each partner's role will gradually shift from operational involvement to strategic oversight, focusing on scalability and autonomy each focusing on their respective departments as outlined later in this agreement. This approach will help build an efficient, self-sustaining business, reducing direct dependence on any single partner and enabling the brand to grow sustainably at scale.

### 5. Decision-Making Protocol
- All business decisions will be made collaboratively through a voting process. Major strategic decisions, particularly those impacting long-term direction, brand use, or financial commitments, will require unanimous consent. Day-to-day operational decisions can be made by majority agreement if they do not impact the partnership’s foundational elements.

### 6. Conflict Resolution
- In the event of a dispute, Partners will first attempt to resolve the issue internally. If necessary, they may jointly engage a third-party mediator with mutual consent to facilitate an equitable solution.

### 7. MoU Duration and Amendment
- This MoU is valid for an initial period of [X years] and is subject to review and potential renewal. Any amendments to this MoU require unanimous agreement from all Partners, ensuring that any modifications align with the partnership’s shared values and evolving business needs.

### 10. Long-Term Commitments
- Each Partner commits to equal participation, both in time and financial support, as required by the business. As the business matures, partner involvement will be adjusted to support sustainable growth and reduce dependence on any single partner for daily operations.

### 11. Profit Distribution & Reinvestment of Profits

Any changes to profit distribution require unanimous consent to maintain fairness and alignment with each partner’s contributions and the business’s financial health.

### 13. Operational Framework for Christ Main Canteen
- The **Christ Main Canteen** will serve as the foundational model for establishing and managing new ventures under the **Panjabi Bites** brand. Each partner will actively contribute to day-to-day operations, supported by a rotational system that provides flexibility and allows for personal time off.
- This operational framework is designed to ensure that key responsibilities are always managed while enabling partners to balance workload and presence. As the brand expands, a similar adaptable framework will be implemented for future ventures, promoting sustainable growth and scalable operations.

### 14. Exit and Share Transfer
- Partners may exit the venture by selling their shares to either an existing or approved new partner, subject to unanimous agreement. The selling price will be mutually determined, ensuring fairness to both the departing partner and those remaining. This clause guarantees continuity and stability in the event of a partner’s exit until such time as the partnership may become publicly traded.
