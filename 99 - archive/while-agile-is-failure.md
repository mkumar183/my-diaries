Sins that are done in name Agile

#### Promise of Agile
Promise of Agile has been a failure. It promised delivering software quickly however, what we are left are tons of meetings termed as ceremonies and ambiguity such as story points that doesn't provide any good measure of productivity. A decade later, we are finding most teams today following rituals and forgotten the real objectives behind these rituals. Agile is falling in the same trap where customs and rituals have taken over the real intent of being lean and productive.
I would like to explore and explain reasons behind agile philosophy and how it shoudl be used and why is it not a great success.

#### Two Major Phases of Software Development 
Though we say that software should be developed as Agile, but actually software development has two critical phases. These phases are water fallish to each other. First phase of software development is setting up the infrastructure. This is the phase where major components, technologies, design patterns, testing and deploying methodologies are decided. Once this phase is set, then second phase should start where in more and more features are added using this platform. However, this seldom happens. A start up that has come up with a product has never thought about the platform. It has just developed tons of features and is now busy adding more features without thinking about the platform that is supposed to support this development. Its like manufacturing cards without creating the assembly line or building the assembly lines after cars are already shipped.  

#### Development of Platform 
Any distributed application is built on a platform. Versatility of this platform determines who the features can be added to this platform.

Software development is very different from traditional manufacturing. In traditional manufacturing, a car and assembly line is designed once. Thereafter cars are build in exact replica of each other with minor differences in models. In case of software, this assembly line is equivalent to the platform development. While adding features is like building cars and shipping them. However, stark difference here is in the fact that each feature is different from others. It's not a copy like in traditional manufacturing setup.

#### Very little attention paid to the platform 
Platform that should support development of features is to be given adequate importance. However, every software is started as some small piece of application which then over a period of expands. Its not built keeping in mind that hundreds if not thousands of features will be added on to this software in coming years. There is no way a platform for which such thought is not given is going to allow you to do that. This is one of the reason why agile fails. 
Agile focuses too much on adding features to product without providing provision to management for maintaining the platform.   

#### Platform development and maintenance is not Agile 
The platform development may not be very time consuming. However, technologies that are used to support these platforms are constantly changing. Also, a software that was good to cater to few thousand users is not has to address millions of users and it was not created for that purpose. This requires rethinking, redesigning, rearchitecting existing applications. 

#### In traditional manufacturing you don't fix a flying plane but in software its done because its Agile
