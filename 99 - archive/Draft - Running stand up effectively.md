##### Standard Routine
-   15 minutes or less
-   Answer three questions:
    -   What did I do yesterday?
    -   What will I do today?
    -   What is blocking me from making progress?
-   Create a 24-hour plan of action for the Scrum team
-   Everyone standing (not required, but encouraged)

##### Smell of a bad stand up 
- Its a routine and boring. People come to it just for formality. 
- Its a status report for manager. It has nothing to do with what other team members are doing.
- There is hardly a team conversation in it. There is conversation between team member to manager only. Or at max QA to team member. 


##### A Good Stand Up 
- A good stand up is for the team. Through stand up whole team becomes aware of if they as a team are moving towards its goal or not. Would team achieve sprint goal or fall short. 
- A good stand up fosters collaboration between team members. Think of a boat that is being rowed by 5 people. What kind of co-ordination they would need in order to stay on course.
- Its a meeting where team is getting together to know if *they* all are on track for their goal or not. If there is any one to one conversation people could do it otherwise. 


### Improving the Stand Up

###### Remember the purpose
Daily stand up is not *reporting status to manager* meeting. Daily stand. up is letting team on what progress you made on your ticket and what kind of things did you find that your team should know. 

Every ceremony in scrum should scream two words: **Team** and **Goals**. If this is ensured then you are successful as a scrum master and manager for the team.

###### Setting sprint goals 
This is really the crux and most important part of your planning meeting. Sprint goal should not be *complete x number of story points*. Sprint goals should be in terms of value being delivered to the product. Which is completing certain set of features (technical or product) or epics. Its okay to say that we should complete x% of certain epic in this sprint. That way, in next sprint certain epic would be done. 


###### Arrange Board by Goals and not Individuals
Its okay to have more than one goal in a sprint for the team. Divide members by these goals and arrange board by the same. This way each subset of your team is aware of how are they doing towards their goals. 

In case a subset of team is working on individual tickets and these are really no major goals then have a separate swimlane for it that way everyone knows that these tickets are just supposed to be complete and any one ticket not getting done will not impact other major sprint goals. 

###### Change The Standup Language
The three questions themselves sound status-like – we’re trying to avoid that! Try changing a few keywords and the intent to communicate obstacles, progress, and planning toward sprint goals outcomes is easily achieved.

-   What did I _accomplish_ yesterday that brought me closer to our sprint goals?
-   What will I _accomplish_ today that will bring us closer to our sprint goals?
-   What is blocking me from achieving our sprint goals?

This would require bit of a training and coaching to your team. Each team member should start becoming more aware and conscious of their team goals.

##### Encourage one thing at a time for one person 
This is a good practice. However, as your team progresses towards journey of becoming a self managed team it should be able to make some deviations to this.
