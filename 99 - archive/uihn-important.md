Talent Refresh Proposal: 
We have identified few folks that we can replace. These are : 
- Avneesh Singh 
- Manisha Herur 
- Zaman Seikh 

In addition to these i would also like to discuss about two engineering managers that we have in unified insight where i see some gaps and we need to fill these because if we don't have right leaders we cannot run and grow the teams.. 

**Vedantham**
What has he done well: 
- Assessment backlog management . 
- Has brought up Othello Team well and team is performing fine . 
- Pixel is a new team. Feedback i get from respective leads is that his help and support is important and has been pitching in for refinements and planning for the team. 

Where is he lacking: 
- Cannot design or lead technical designs and spikes effectively. 
- Cannot coach engineers via PR Reviews and code reviews. 
- Cannot make technical choices or decisions that are critical involving security and performance of the product. He needs assistance of someone has to tell what to do. 
- Cannot help in improving engineering processes such as clean coding practices or improving the system. 
- Limited understanding on software delivery process and its dependent on US Teams
- On assessment for a long period of time, he has not gone into details of issues and gotten a handle of things. Until last year there was a high dependency on Ela. 
- On engineering side, does not have a good handle on how the system works. e.g. git runners, tenants, branching and how code is delivered to production. 
- Veracode scans has taken too long to get handle of it  
- Has not shown initiative and taken interest in our system problems and pitch in those to solve these.  

I see him as a weak contender for Engineering Manager role. As of now, if we let him go there would be an impact. However, in longer run we need to either groom someone internally in this role or hire someone who is good at engineering work. 


**Vaidehi**
What he has done well:
- He takes initiatives front ends several customer issues that are mostly data issues. He is able to provide initial analysis and in case these require code changes then issues are moved to DM Team.  
- His skills are good in SQL but apart from that not very sure. 
- He has been working with support teams giving them knowledge on various modules that we have and how to triage those issues in support itself. This has been pretty good so far. 


Where he is lacking: 
- Cannot design or lead technical designs and spikes effectively. 
- Cannot coach engineers via PR Reviews and code reviews. 
- Cannot make technical choices or decisions that are critical involving security and performance of the product. He needs assistance of someone has to tell what to do. 
- Cannot help in improving engineering processes. His understanding on software delivery process is very limited and its dependent on US Teams. 
- Complex content issues require triage and solving by US Team 
- Faced challenges for Co-Teacher functionality since team did not know RLS while team has been working on content. Similarly, on TMA also there were challenges since platform knowledge was not there. 
- High number of tickets get blocked and slipping through sprints
- Dependency on platform team 

Since Vaidehi does a great front ending role on customer issues, my suggestion would be to aligned his role to Cloudops or Support Organisation. He has good knowledge of our data model and functional application knowledge. That can be leveraged well and he can be successful in one of these roles.
