Team has to be organized in a way that makes delivery to the customer. 

For customer there should be single point of contact. This SPOC should have direct control over the team. 

If teams can be aligned in this way, it will lead to maximum customer satisfaction. 

Avoid fragmented services. 

Skill based organizations are very bad when it comes to delivery end to end functionality to clients.
