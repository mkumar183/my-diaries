### 5 Ways to get in shape for higher productivity 
Productivity is not measured by story points. Its measured by ease of adding features to your product. In case your team is struggling to maintain your application and add new features to it , then it means it suffers from poor productivity syndroms. 

1. Divide your product in components and product areas 
2. Arrive at list of services that could be created to better encapsulate the business logic in your application 
3. Create a go forward architecture for your product such that your software is divided in at least 4 layers and decent size business services each catering to sizable number of use cases. 
4. Create product documentation 
5. Train your team on technologies being used and product architecture. Component by component, Service by service. 
6. Create a process for refactoring the code. Set refactoring in practice with your developers. 
7. Inculcate quality code practices 
8. Build automation for deployement and testing both 
9. Build more test cases that can help you ship your software more frequently and easily 
10. Measure agility of each component. 
11. Measure your architecture by kind of changes that end up impacting multiple areas. If this is happening too much that means your architecture is bad.
