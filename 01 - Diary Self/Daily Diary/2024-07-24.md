When you live your life with presence of God, then you ask what is righteous action i should take in my work and in my life. Righteous action is what God wants us to do or behave as. You immediately bring God's presence in your life. Deciding not to gossip or criticize others is righteous. Serving others with selfless motive and doing what is fair to others and beneficial for the organization and not for the self are all righteous actions. When you think of acting as per these you are bringing presence of God in your life and now automatically you leave your little self as a doer and rather are allowing God to be the doer. In this way you eliminate the little self from your life and start becoming your higher Self. This is how Guru has transformed you and has made you in his own image.
