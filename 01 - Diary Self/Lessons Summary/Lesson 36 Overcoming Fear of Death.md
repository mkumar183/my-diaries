Understanding concept of death is freedom from chains of body and an entry into realms of astral lights. Yogis love to embrace this death rather than be fearful of it since this will bring you closer to the Beloved. Those who have done good deeds would experience great things as a soul post death. 

#### Begin With a Prayer 
Divine Mother, intoxicate me with devotion’s wine: I will drink of Thee until death. My earthly desires shall die, and I will live in Thee forever. Thou art the Ocean where the rivers of all my desires meet. Thou art the celestial songbird to whose sweet melodies I am eager to listen. Thou art the flute of eternity, which tames my wild passions into a dance of everlasting harmony. Tear away all veils of matter, fling open the doors of beauty, that I may behold Thee within and without, everywhere.

### Story of Rakusha Bandit 
Who does one little good deed and because of it it reaches gates of heaven. 

#### Point to ponder
Are we doing even one small act of goodness in this world or are all our acts are done with selfishness. If so, we should think and try to do a little good here that will take us across the border of Hades. 

#### Affirmations to Practice
O Divine Mother, after this rhythmic dance of incarnations, after the rising footsteps of birth and the falling footsteps of death, I will slide into Thy sea of Immortality.

Divine Mother, the power of Thy love crucifies all my thoughts of doubt and fear; that I may rise, triumphant over death, and ascend on wings of light to Thee.
