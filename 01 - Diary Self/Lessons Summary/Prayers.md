Lesson 22: Joy of Meditation: 

O Fathomless Ocean of Treasure! may I dive deep in the seas of meditation for Thy wisdom pearls. Teach me to dive again and again in meditation, deeper and deeper, until I find Thine immortal pearls of wisdom and divine joy. By my sacred perseverance, guide me to discover in the most secret waters of consciousness the Pearl of Great Price.
