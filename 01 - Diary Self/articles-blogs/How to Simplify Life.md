Problem: 
Simplicity is intended while complexity is natural. When life becomes complex we end up getting more stressed and unhappy. Life can get out of our control causing mysery. 

Problem deep dive: 
Life has various aspects. Financial, Family, Relationship, Status, Personal happiness, Health, Food, Career, Kids, Education, Entertainment, Learning, Satisfaction etc. These area of life are interlinked with each other. Problem in one are can shake all other areas and can cause stress and unhappiness. 

Solution:
Mantra of simplification is compartmentalization or categorization of portions of life in different boxes. Just like a complex system is where partitions are not very clear and then there is too much dependencies between these components, a life becomes complex when compartments in life are not very clear and there are too many dependencies in these parts of life. Circular dependencies between parts of life can cause you to tumble into depressions. 

Process of simplification is: 
1. Identify clear compartments of life. Health, Family, Profession, Finances, Needs (Food, Clothing, House), Desires, Cars, Travel, Hobbies. 
2. Limit size of each box. e.g. relationships and friends. Try to contain number of active relationships you want to maintain and kind of friends you want to have. Limit it to the ones that are really helping you to serve your purpose. 
3. Understand relationships and dependencies between these boxes. ensures there is no single point of failure in your system. e.g. your whole family depending upon single source of income and not having enough savings can be a single point of failure. Health can be a single point of failure as well. 
4. Cultivate and find a clear purpose in life. Once purpose of your life is clear now you can work on fine tuning each box of your life and know what is helping you towards that purpose and what is not. A life without a purpose is something which will go totally uncontrolled since you do not know what do you want. Have a statement that defines vision and mission of your life. Envision what you want to be 10 years, 20 years or 30 years or at death. Define a mission statement for your life to relentlessly work towards your vision of life.
6. Cultivate minimalism in life. Necessariy necessities vs unnecessary necessities. Properism can help you align your life's goals.  which means do things that help you towards your final vision and mission. If you want to be happy and peaceful ask question is this leading you to long lasting peace and happiness or is it something that's ephemeral. 
7. Cultivate Detachments: Differentiate things with which you like to have attachments. Become aware of your attachments. 
8. Cultivate higher self awareness. Know your likes, dislikes, desires, things you hate and learn to manage these. 
9. Practice thought control or mindfulness
10. Foundation of all boxes above is character that comes with moral conduct. Life is like a boat and a single bad habit is like a hole in the boat through which water can seep in. Closing all holes of the boat is absolutely necessary to ensure boat remains strong and afloat. Work on your moral weaknesses and use tools like affirmations, faith in God, service and respect for others in order to overcome these weaknesses. 


Take one step at a time and slowly as you develop better mind control and have clear purpose of life you will be able to cut down lot of noise from your life, have a clear focus and lead a simple and happy life. Remember Simplicity is intentional. Things that look simple are not easy to create and so is life.
