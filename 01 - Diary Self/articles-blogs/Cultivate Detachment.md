Attachments cause us pain of loss. We may not eliminate attachments but we can reduce these to minimum ones that really matter. 

Opposite of liberation is attachmemt.
leberty gives happiness and joy
attachments lead to pain and sorrow. 
attachments are shackles thru which soul is chained to this world.

deeper the attachments deeper the sorrow caused by them. these attachments also cause us to come back to this earth again and again. attachments are results of our karmas and manifest in form of desires. 

attachments are like chains, desires are like iron giving it strength, ego is the hook holding the chain with ego in one end and soul the other end. soul germinates into body to fulfill these desires. however, these chains get stronger and more entangled with more desires and now soul is completelt entangled via body in this world leading to endless sorrows with no hope of freedom.

attachments live in material things in form of desire to possess them or a status associated with those possessions, or in form of expectations in relationships and could be semse of pride in a status and position in society. the root of attachments is ego and desires. 

why we need detachment ?
since attachment is with things thats temporary as those things are taken away from us or someone does not fulfill pur expectations it causes us sorrow. more we fulfill sensory desires more desires are creted by law of maya making our soul endlessly entangled captured in this world. our soul nature is liberation, freedom, endless joy and happiness. we want that. its our birth right. but by getting entangled in attachments we have forgotten our true nature and are drowned in sea of sins. 

how to detach:
- develop self awareness through meditation and introspection. 
- self-study and identify your biggest attachments. 
- cultivate reverence for God and Guru.
- differentiate between necessary necessities and unnecessary necessities. 
- disassociate your status from your possessions. 
- live an average life. do not go extreme else you may face resistance from society.
- adapt minimalism. 
- meditate and realize the truth of souls and relationships.

Problem Deep Dive and Understanding nature of attachments:
- 2 dimensions. Intensity and Quantity (number of things you are attached to)
- pay attention to duration of pain and pleasure
- Higher the intensity more pain this will cause to you 
- More number of things, people, emotions you are attached more disturbances to your mind and life. 

Solution: 
- Mindfulness and meditation. 
- Understand real nature of life, happiness, pleasure and pain.

- Pay attention to duration of pain or pleasure caused 
- 

- having possessions is not a problem but fear of losing possessions, association of status with a house or a car and desire for more is what causes us problem. 
- having relationships is not a problem. having expectations from relations is. 
- having status is not a problem but desire for higher status and fear of losing current is. 

how to cultivate detachment ?
Guru ji says live like butter on water. its not possible to live without others in this world. we can seek a solitary life but we are associated and connected with the rest. In such cases its best to live around all but not being attached to them. 

Things: find out things that you have extreme desire for. See if you can live without these. are these practical or logical possessions.

House: you need one home to live. It being big or small is relative. But having one home is not wrong attachment. we all need security to live. we are not in this world to live like beggars. self pride is not attachment. 

Money: having enough money for your own security is not attacemt. Amoumt of money you possess is a measure of the services you have done to others. this world is cruel. you should have enough security for emergencies that you can buy services you will need. use a good financial planner to compute these necessities and have money to serve these needs. 

Social Obligations: kids marriage, education etc are essential obligations. plan for these and get these done. 

Hoarding money beyond these needs is greed bit know that you will end up giving all of it in charity at the end of your life. Until then no harm in keeping it in your control. 

Relationships: know that all relations are selfish in nature. yet to live in this world you need all of these. Maimtain your necessary relations without any expectations from them. Cultivate love as much as you can but do not expect anything in return. 

Status: maintain a good social status and know that its your birth right to maintain it. But be ready for God's decision anytime gor any of these. He is the giver and He can take all of these away any day. Surrender all and everything to God.
