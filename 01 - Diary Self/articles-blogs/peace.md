jHappiness does not come from pleasures.
it comes from peace. 
peace comes from tyaga which means sacrifice, giving up, forsaking, resigning or renunciation. its opposite of bhoga, sanchay, sangrah. 

as we give up material possessions and fruits of our actions we start liking God the one who is giver and posseser of everything. by loving Him we find everything. 

this by giving up smaller pleasures and fruits we start ascending towards gaining everything. 

since soul wants this whole kingdom this alone can make you attain peace. 

hence to gain peace start giving up everything that is attaching you to this world. only keep what you absolutely need to worship God reat everything give away and then you will see how beautifully you gain lot more than you gave i.e. peace and God Himself. 

relationships are on expectations leading to frustrations and struggle.
