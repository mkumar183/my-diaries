after having read article on how to partition your life in blocks of time and bringing context and focus in each of these blocks, we will deep dive into this article as what strategies to apply to make each block of these times more effective. 

First step of labeling the blocks of times is most important step. this step itself will help you simplify your life and have fewer contexts. Now lets say you have identified 3-5 major types of time blocks you like to have you can now work more effectively improving each of these. 


For me, biggest block is Work its about 8-9 hours where i spend on weekdays. Weekend blocks are different than weekdays. Reat of the blocks are Sleep (yes you can improve effectiveness of it), Self (meditation and reading), daily chores, Travel (mostly to work), Family and Friends. 

entering into context of meditation block: 
- start with a prayer that i am immortal, part of vast ocean, i am soul. 
- end with an affirmation. 
- carry feeling of meditation beyond this time block. 


Contextualuzing to work block: 
pray to God: help me to fully conventrate on my work. help me do my work as service to all others without attachment. And help me to dedicate all fruits for you and you alone. thou are the doer not I. help me be calm and handle highest priority and impactful things first with cool head. 
frequently during work bring Guru presence. try to please Him with your work. Show case achievements of your teams and not yours.
