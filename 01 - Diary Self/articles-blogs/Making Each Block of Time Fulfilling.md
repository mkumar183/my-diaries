after having read article on how to partition your life in blocks of time and bringing context and focus in each of these blocks, we will deep dive into this article as what strategies to apply to make each block of these times more effective. 

First step of labeling the blocks of times is most important step. this step itself will help you simplify your life and have fewer contexts. Now lets say you have identified 3-5 major types of time blocks you like to have you can now work more effectively improving each of these. 

For me, biggest block is Work its about 8-9 hours where i spend on weekdays. Weekend blocks are different than weekdays. Reat of the blocks are Sleep (yes you can improve effectiveness of it), Self (meditation and reading), daily chores, Travel (mostly to work), Family and Friends. 

structure of each block:
- start with a prayer
- get into the context as quickly as possible. deep double breathing. 
- see from where you left last time (maintain some logs). 
- end with a prayer and summary of where u will start next. 

entering into context of meditation block: 
- start with a prayer that i am immortal, part of vast ocean, i am soul. 
- end with an affirmation. 
- carry feeling of meditation beyond this time block.
