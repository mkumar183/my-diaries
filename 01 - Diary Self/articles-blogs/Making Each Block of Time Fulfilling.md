after having read article on how to partition your life in blocks of time and bringing context and focus in each of these blocks, we will deep dive into this article as what strategies to apply to make each block of these times more effective. 

First step of labeling the blocks of times is most important step. this step itself will help you simplify your life and have fewer contexts. Now lets say you have identified 3-5 major types of time blocks you like to have you can now work more effectively improving each of these. 


For me, biggest block is Work its about 8-9 hours where i spend on weekdays. Weekend blocks are different than weekdays. Reat of the blocks are Sleep (yes you can improve effectiveness of it), Self (meditation and reading), daily chores, Travel (mostly to work), Family and Friends. 

structure of each block:
- start with a prayer
- get into the context as quickly as possible. deep double breathing. 
- see from where you left last time (maintain some logs). 
- end with a prayer and summary of where u will start next. 

entering into context of meditation block: 
- start with a prayer that i am immortal, part of vast ocean, i am soul. 
- end with an affirmation. 
- carry feeling of meditation beyond this time block. 


Managing work blocks: 
- prayer to God for 
- help me to fully conventrate 
- let my work be service to others
- be detached  attachment. 
- dedicate all fruits for you
- thou are the doer not I. 
- be calm 
- handle highest priority and impactful things first.
- please God and Guru 
- to be detached help me view my work as a game. where my highest goal is to cleanse myself of my impurities such as ego. examine kind of challenges God is throwing at you and get the hints as what he wants you to improve upon. is it ego ? is it pride / humility. is it attachment ? 
- know that doing ur job assigned perfectly is ur job but not that company should be perfect. 
- god to help u welcome diversity 
- be a good servent to ue seniors as well as juniors. 
- frequently during work bring Guru presence. try to please Him with your work. Show case achievements of your teams and not yours. ask him, am i being ur best student. 
- retrospect: how happy u r working. if not then reflect deeply what you need to improve. 
- have u cultivated respect/shraddha for all ?
