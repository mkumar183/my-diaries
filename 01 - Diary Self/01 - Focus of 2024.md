Observing Each Moment: 
1. Partition the moments into periods based on their context: Location, Situation, People Around you, your emotions/state etc. 
2. Become aware of **context** of each moment. Weather you are at work, with friends, social gathering, at home, meditating. Get in the context of the moment. Know that God has brought this moment to you. Be it good or bad. Its for your teaching and learning and growing this moment, situation, people is brought to you. 
3. Become aware of change of context of the moment. e.g. getting into a meeting, getting into a travel to reach office, reaching office, waking, meditating, eating, being with family. When you change your context, get into that context fully as much as possible. You can take a deep breath and tell yourself now i leave this situation and get myself into the new situation. I will pick up the old situation or context later on. 
4. Try to be in one context at a time. This will give you focus and fulfillment.
5. Learn how to bring God's presence in each of these moments. Remember people around you are sent by God (good and bad). Situation is sent to you for you to learn and overcome. Do not get overjoyed with the good situation and down with not so good situations. Even minded ness in all situations is a key ability you can develop. 
6. Have gratitude and acceptance for these situations and moments. Remember, the situation you are undergoing is something you envisioned or wanted at some point of time in your life. 
7. Thou are the doer not I, Thy will be done, not mine. Remember this line again and again. And do everything surrendering to God. 
8. Take your eyes frequently to kutastha and bring God's presence. Recollect image of your Guru and Istha and know they are Sakshi of all that you are doing. 
9. Remember each moment you live on this planet is so important. You need to make every ounce of it. You should use each moment to get closer to God and feel his bliss and presence. Each moment is taking you closer to God is the moment that you have made useful rest is all wasted which will not come back. Life is utmost precious. 


The minutes are more important than the years. If you fill the minutes of your life with thoughts of God, you will find the years of your life automatically saturated with the consciousness of God.

The minutes are more important than years. If you do not fill the minutes of your life with thoughts of God, the years will slip by; and when you need Him the most, you may be unable to feel His presence. But if you fill the minutes of your life with divine aspirations, automatically the years will be saturated with His presence.

Live each moment completely and the future will take care of itself.

Focus on your emotions, thoughts and finally actions. Its finally your actions that matters. 

The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly.

The past is history, the future is a mystery, but the present is a gift. That's why it's called the present.

Be as simple as you can be; you will be astonished to see how uncomplicated and happy your life can become.
