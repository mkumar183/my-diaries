**Embrace Living in the Present Moment**

8. To get mind fixed on God, kill all attachments from world.
9. Yoga chitta vritti nirodha. (Vrittis in form of pleasures of the world and fears arising from lack of faith)

The minutes are more important than the years. If you fill the minutes of your life with thoughts of God, you will find the years of your life automatically saturated with the consciousness of God.

The minutes are more important than years. If you do not fill the minutes of your life with thoughts of God, the years will slip by; and when you need Him the most, you may be unable to feel His presence. But if you fill the minutes of your life with divine aspirations, automatically the years will be saturated with His presence.

Live each moment completely and the future will take care of itself.

Focus on your emotions, thoughts and finally actions. Its finally your actions that matters. 

The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly.

The past is history, the future is a mystery, but the present is a gift. That's why it's called the present.

Be as simple as you can be; you will be astonished to see how uncomplicated and happy your life can become.
