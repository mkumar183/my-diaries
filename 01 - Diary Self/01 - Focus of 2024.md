**Embrace Living in the Present Moment** 
1. Notice each moment fully. As you work, realize it's the Divine acting through you.
2. Grow your respect for the Divine. Jesus and Krishna visited Earth to share their teachings.
3. By staying aware and focused on each moment, you'll slowly rise above everyday concerns.
4. During breaks, turn the spotlight of your mind to God. Recall His presence and wisdom. (Gita Gyan Points)Â 
5. If your mind wanders, ask yourself why and think of the steady state of mind described in ancient texts.
7. Rather than seeking God, aim to make Him or your teacher happy. Consider if your thoughts and actions would please them.
8. At day's end, look back on how you felt and acted throughout the day.
10. Stick to your daily spiritual habits. They'll help you in the long term.

The minutes are more important than the years. If you fill the minutes of your life with thoughts of God, you will find the years of your life automatically saturated with the consciousness of God.

The minutes are more important than years. If you do not fill the minutes of your life with thoughts of God, the years will slip by; and when you need Him the most, you may be unable to feel His presence. But if you fill the minutes of your life with divine aspirations, automatically the years will be saturated with His presence.

Live each moment completely and the future will take care of itself.

The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly.

The past is history, the future is a mystery, but the present is a gift. That's why it's called the present.

Be as simple as you can be; you will be astonished to see how uncomplicated and happy your life can become.
