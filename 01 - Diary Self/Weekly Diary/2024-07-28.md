Focus of the Week: Be in the present moment. Cultivate habit of being in present. 

Resent dwelling in past or dreaming or getting scared about future. Enjoy the present moment. In case there are thoughts from past, write these down, analyze and then throw them after knowing what you have learned from these. In case thoughts of future comes further analyze , question and then trash these since these are of no use. If you foresee something threatening.

Focus from this point on will be on reducing extent of lust that you possess. Method to be used is analysis method. It is triggered by visually seeing a person. This triggers an electromagnetic wave in the brain signaling an expected pleasure. As per the technique explained in one of the talk, intercept this signal right there and ask this question. Is this pleasure for real ? 

Understand and be convinced that sexual pleasure is not real. A false image is created in your brain through movies and other material that is fake. The pleasure is very momentary in nature. Also, this is something you can achieve with your own spouse easily. If this pleasure was so great you would be having this with your own spouse everyday. The fact that you are not doing it means this pleasure is not real. Imagining a higher pleasure with another person is fake and imaginary. Discard it from your mind with this repeated affirmation. Sexual pleasure is fake and false. Its momentary. Its way too expensive and unreal in nature. 

The other fact you should let your mind know is that your mind seeks not this sex but the love originated from the person. You are already getting all this love from your own partner. No one outside will give this love to you without anything in exchange. And this exchange is not going to be cheap. Since by giving this another person will expect back everything from you which is not unfair. Hence this pleasure is not just expensive rather its not within boundaries of social limitations even possible. Affirm this in your mind again and again. Sexual exchange is expensive and impractical in this social world. I will seek such love from my partner and pure love only God can give. I will not look for this pleasure and love.
