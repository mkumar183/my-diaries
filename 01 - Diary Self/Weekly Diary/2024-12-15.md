1. Pay attention to your feelings. Remember. Change Me and not my circumstances. In this case, what someone says to you should not impact you. You should be able to ignore this. Since you know what you are doing are the right things. You do not need to change what you are doing right. But change what is causing pain or low feelings. Feel superb and be proud of yourself that despite all this you are able to stand tall and continue what you believe in to be right. 

bahut se manjar aayenge aur
bahut samundar aayenge 
tu apna kufaar na khona 
na hi kisi ki rah sun na 
chalte jana usi raah par 
jahan milegi madhushala 

बहुत से तूफ़ान आएंगे,  
बहुत सी कठिन राहें मिलेंगी।  
पर तू अपना हौंसला न खोना,  
ना किसी और की राह को सुनना।  
बस चलते रहना उस राह पर,  
जहां तुझे मिलेगी तेरी मधुशाला।
