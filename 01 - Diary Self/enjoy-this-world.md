God created this to enjoy itself. God divided itself into many and introduced ego in each for creating the drama. God loves this drama. But God also loves each of us and wants us to come back. We being in the ego want to enjoy this world as well. But its not possible to enjoy it as long as we are attached to this world and have ego. 

Krishna showed a great example of this by taking avatar of a kid and doing its leela by irritating all gopies and Yashoda. However, Krishna never did any of this under his ego or for the benefit of theself. In fact, on every occassion He made greatest sacrifices. 
But by being innocent like a kid and doing things against the wishes of others he let others get angry on him but later realize they had no option but to love Krishna. 

Since Krishna's teachings are getting liberation while living in the world and not by renouncing the world this gives us a great way to live in this world. Never be serious or plomb. Remain mischievious but devoid of ego. 
This way even if we upset others they will end up loving us and we will remain humble and innocent and best part is we will learn to enjoy this world like a movie rather than getting involved in it. 

But be very cautious. if you start doing these mischieves for selfish reasons you will drown yourself.
