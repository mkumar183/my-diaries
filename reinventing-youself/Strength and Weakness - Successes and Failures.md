**Strength**: Instead of rising higher, i went to different companies and worked on different technologies. This did not work so well for my career however, i think today that's a strength. While i am very good and deep in backend technologies, I have a broader understanding of many technologies, I have managed teams. I can break things down in smaller things and ask questions on how things work. This gives a great power over engineers since now they can discuss and brainstorm problems with me and do not feel that i am disconnected. In fact, due to my broader understanding I am able to ask questions through which they are able to solve problems. 
e.g. date problem. replication failure. we need to change data in source. and i asked questions around this. 
- Ability to Zoom in and Zoom out 
- Specialist at being generalist : building high performance team
- Ability to convince 

**Weakness**: I am a good generalist. I have not worked end to end deep on very large systems in my early career on scaling in cloud systems. DotNet, Angular, Patterns But i need to spend little time and take few courses and may be 1-2 hands on hello world examples and then i would understand and would be ready. 
- Opinionated (spotify model, volatility based architecture)
- At times I find it hard to articulate my ideas (i have started writing recently, English not being first language)
- Not good at self advertisements and marketing 
I have focused a lot more on how and not on what to achieve. I think this is a more graduation for me.
