## 24: Compassion towards all beings (Daya)

**Lesson Goal Statement:**
Today we will study about quality #16 Compassion towards all beings (Daya). Let's first read what Guruji wrote about this property in *God talks to Arjuna*. 

Compassion toward all beings (daya) is necessary for divine realization, for God Himself is overflowing with this quality. 

Those with a tender heart can put themselves in the place of others, feel their suffering, and try to alleviate it. By daya the law of “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth” and the stern exactions of karma are modified. If the Lord did not show mercy and give special amnesties and divine paroles from sin, His erring children would suffer indefinitely, life after weary life. 

Provided a man tries by self-discipline to remove the mountainous load of his past errors, God comes to the rescue. When He feels that His child is sufficiently repentant of his offenses, He destroys the age-old darkness of sin instantaneously by manifesting the liberating light of His presence. 

Gautama Buddha was an incarnation of mercy. It is told that he even offered his own life to save a goat that had been made ready for sacrifice. The king who was performing the rite spared the animal’s life and became a devout follower of the “Enlightened One.” The human father, if he is wholly guided by the masculine principle of reason, will judge his son’s fault according to the law. But the mother, filled with the tenderness of feminine feeling, is a symbol of divine compassion; she will forgive the son even if he is a murderer. 

Devotees find profuse remission of sins in worshipping God as the ever merciful Divine Mother instead of as the mathematically minded Divine Judge who dispenses justice through karmic law.

Our goal today in this class is to understand about importance of this quality and then have some tips or methods to implement in our daily life and form some new habits. (Practicing compassion/forgiveness vs a tit-for-tat method)

## What Is Compassion? (Scientific Source)
https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/compassion/definition

Compassion literally means “to suffer together.” Among emotion researchers, it is [defined](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303600556_What_is_Compassion_and_How_Can_We_Measure_it_A_Review_of_Definitions_and_Measures) as the feeling that arises when you are confronted with another’s suffering and feel motivated to relieve that suffering.

Compassion is not the same as [empathy](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/empathy) or [altruism](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/altruism), though the concepts are related. While empathy refers more generally to our ability to take the perspective of and feel the emotions of another person, compassion is when those feelings and thoughts include the desire to help. Altruism, in turn, is the kind, selfless behavior often prompted by feelings of compassion, though one can feel compassion without acting on it, and altruism isn’t always motivated by compassion.

While cynics may dismiss compassion as touchy-feely or irrational, scientists have started to map the biological basis of compassion, [suggesting its deep evolutionary purpose](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_compassionate_species). This research has shown that when we feel compassion, our heart rate slows down, we secrete the “bonding hormone” oxytocin, and regions of the brain linked to [empathy](http://home.uchicago.edu/~decety/Files/other/Decety_BCNR_2004.pdf), [caregiving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZGJV5TRk_c), and [feelings of pleasure](http://harbaugh.uoregon.edu/Papers/HMB%202007%20Science%20Tax%20Give.pdf) light up, which often results in our wanting to approach and care for other people.

A great example of Compassion: Mother Teresa 
### Empathy vs Compassion 
Source: https://www.betterup.com/blog/compassion-vs-empathy
At a basic level, empathy involves understanding and sharing the feelings of others. While compassion is the act of showing kindness, support, and a desire to alleviate someone's suffering without necessarily sharing their emotional experience. Empathy is about feeling with, while compassion is about acting with care.
### Stories: Chapter 12 of AOY 

1. Story of how Yogananda was to take procession in Puri and he was worried that how He will complete the procession in such hot sun. Yukteshwar ji assured him that it will be taken care. And that day it rained. God was so mercyful. 
  
“You see how God feels for us,” Master replied after I had expressed my gratitude. “The Lord responds to all and works for all. Just as He sent rain at my plea, so He fulfills any sincere desire of the devotee. Seldom do men realize how often God heeds their prayers. He is not partial to a few, but listens to everyone who approaches Him trustingly. His children should ever have implicit faith in the loving-kindness of their Omnipresent Father.” 

1. Jesus when on cross had these words : forgive thee since thee know not what they are doing. 

“Because you and my son think so highly of Swami Sri Yukteswar, I will take a look at him.” The tone of voice used by Dr. Narayan Chunder Roy implied that he was humouring the whim of half-wits. I concealed my indignation, in the best tradition of the proselyter. My companion, a veterinary surgeon, was a confirmed agnostic. His young son Santosh had implored me to take an interest in his father. So far, my invaluable aid had been a bit on the invisible side. Dr. Roy accompanied me the following day to the Serampore hermitage. After Master had granted him a brief interview, marked for the most part by stoic silence on both sides, the visitor brusquely departed. “Why bring a dead man to the ashram?” Sri Yukteswar looked at me inquiringly as soon as the door had closed on the Calcutta skeptic. 

“Sir! The doctor is very much alive!” “But in a short time he will be dead.” I was shocked. “Sir, this will be a terrible blow to his son. Santosh yet hopes for time to change his father’s materialistic views. I beseech you, Master, to help the man.” “Very well—for your sake.” My guru’s face was impassive. “The proud horse doctor is far gone in diabetes, although he does not know it. In fifteen days he will take to his bed. The physicians will give him up for lost; his natural time to leave this earth is six weeks from today. Owing to your intercession, however, on that date he will recover. But there is one condition: you must get him to wear an astrological bangle. He will doubtless object as violently as one of his horses before an operation.” Master chuckled. After a silence, during which I wondered how Santosh and I might best employ the arts of cajolery on the doctor, Sri Yukteswar made further disclosures.

“As soon as the man gets well, advise him not to eat meat. He will not heed this counsel, however; and in six months, just as he is feeling at his best, he will drop dead.” My guru added, “The six-month extension of life is granted him only because of your plea.” The following day I suggested to Santosh that he order an armlet at the jeweller’s. It was ready in a week, but Dr. Roy refused to put it on. “I am in the best of health. You will never impress me with these astrological superstitions.” The doctor glanced at me belligerently. I recalled with amusement that Master had justifiably compared the man to a baulky horse. Another seven days passed; the doctor, suddenly ill, meekly consented to wear the bangle. Two weeks later the physician in attendance told me that his patient’s case was hopeless. He supplied harrowing details of the ravages inflicted by diabetes. I shook my head. “My guru has said that, after a sickness lasting one month, Dr. Roy will be well.”

The physician stared at me incredulously. But he sought me out a fortnight later, with an apologetic air. “Dr. Roy has made a complete recovery!” he exclaimed. “It is the most amazing case in my experience. Never before have I seen a dying man show such an inexplicable comeback. Your guru must indeed be a healing prophet!” After one interview with Dr. Roy, during which I repeated Sri Yukteswar’s advice about a meatless diet, I did not see the man again for six months. He stopped for a chat one evening as I sat on the piazza of my family home. “Tell your teacher that by eating meat frequently, I have wholly regained my strength. His unscientific ideas on diet have not influenced me.” It was true that Dr. Roy looked a picture of health. But the next day Santosh came running to me from his home on the next block. “This morning Father dropped dead!” This case was one of my strangest experiences with Master. He healed the rebellious veterinary surgeon in spite of his disbelief, and extended the man’s natural term on earth by six months, just because of my earnest supplication. Sri Yukteswar was boundless in his kindness when responding to an urgent prayer of a devotee.
