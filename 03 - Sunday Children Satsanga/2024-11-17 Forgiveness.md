Forgiveness in the man of God consists in not inflicting, or wishing to inflict, punishment on those who harm or wrong him. He knows that the cosmic law will see to it that all injustices are rectified; it is unnecessary and presumptuous to attempt to hasten its workings or to determine their form. Retribution at the hands of the immutable law of karma has for its proper and far-seeing purpose the eventual spiritual redemption of the sinner. 

This is not to say that wrongdoers should have no curtailment. Social structure demands constraints for its survival. Those whose duty it is to enforce just laws for the well-being of humanity act as instruments of karmic law. Their judgements should be meted out without malice or a spirit of revenge. Even if justice does not seem to prevail, the karmic law will not fail to balance the scale. 

A passage in the Mahabharata is as follows: “One should forgive, under any injury. It hath been said that the continuation of the species is due to man’s being forgiving. Forgiveness is holiness; by forgiveness the universe is held together. Forgiveness is the might of the mighty; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is quiet of mind. Forgiveness and gentleness are the qualities of the Self-possessed. They represent eternal virtue.” 

When a weak man, slapped by a bully, says “I forgive you” and runs away, he is likely to be motivated not by forgiveness but by cowardice. When a powerful person, hurt by an enemy, shows compassion and forbearance instead of crushing that foe, he displays real forgiveness. 

The spirit of forgiveness arises from long practice in spiritual discipline and from realization of our inseverable human and divine brotherhood. 

Just before Mahatma Gandhi died in 1948, he lifted his hands from his bullet-torn body to bestow on the assassin a humble gesture of forgiveness. “All the sacrifices of his selfless life had made possible that final loving gesture,” I wrote in a tribute to the Mahatma. 

Jesus, holding the power to summon to his aid “more than twelve legions of angels,”7 did not resist arrest and crucifixion, and prayed: “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”8 With divine insight he was ever able to see man apart from his errors. Christ had perfect understanding that each human being is essentially a soul, a child of God, whose evil conduct is no expression of his real nature but is caused by ignorance, “knowing-not” — the dread, but not eternal, state of delusion into which men fall when they forget their true identity.


Story: 

One day, a disciple of **Swami Sri Yukteswar** returned to the hermitage after having betrayed the trust of his Guru. This disciple had left the ashram years earlier, taking money that did not belong to him. Despite this grave act of dishonesty, the Guru welcomed him back with complete forgiveness and kindness.

The disciple, overcome with guilt and remorse, fell at Sri Yukteswar’s feet, confessing his misdeeds. Sri Yukteswar’s response was remarkable—he did not scold or reprimand the disciple for his past actions. Instead, he spoke words full of love and understanding:  
**"No matter what wrong you have done, it cannot be greater than my love for you."**

This profound statement left an indelible mark on Yogananda, who witnessed the exchange. It demonstrated that a true Guru embodies the divine qualities of compassion and forgiveness, transcending human tendencies toward anger or judgment. The disciple, transformed by this unconditional acceptance, resolved to reform his ways.

Likewise Story of how yogananda left Guru ji and then returned back.
