## 26: Lack of Conceit (na atimanita)

#### Lesson Goal Statement:
Today we'll explore quality #26 Humility (na atimanita). Let's start with Guruji's words from __God talks to Arjuna__.

Humility (na atimanita) is a divine trait. It means not being overly proud. Despite His infinite cosmic powers, the Lord isn't prideful. He quietly works for our salvation through the drive behind good actions and the silent pull of His love in each soul.

It's okay to know you're better at something if you have proof. But thinking you're the absolute best or superior in all areas is foolish and egotistical.

When you believe you outshine others in most aspects of life, you lack humility.

Those free from self-importance grow spiritually until they unite with God. _****God's mercy can't gather on pride's peaks, but easily collects in humility's valley****_.

Our aim today is to grasp the importance of humility and learn ways to practice it daily, forming new habits.
#### Understanding Lack of Conceit (Humility): 
A little knowledge can be risky. Devotees might feel vain, wrongly thinking they embody what they know. Remember, ****pride often leads to a fall****.

Humble people don't see themselves as better than others in everything. They might know they excel in some areas, backed by evidence. Recognizing you're not the best at everything makes you humble. When you're humble:

You're like an empty knowledge cup, ready to learn and grow. Egotistical people struggle to learn (peaks vs valleys). They wrongly think they're full (when empty), while humble folks think the opposite (they feel empty when full).

You draw people in naturally. Pride pushes others away (like an ugly face), while humility attracts (like a sweet scent or strong magnet that pulls everyone close but seems simple, like God). Humble folks respect others and enjoy learning from everyone around them.

Pride stems from feeling inferior (though it may look like superiority), while humility comes from wisdom or knowing your true self.

A proud person is like a ****noisy empty can****, while a humble one is like a ****barrel full of fine wine****. Little knowledge breeds pride, vast wisdom breeds humility (God is humble). Proud people often talk about how important they are.

Guru ji compares proud folks to peacocks, showing off their colorful feathers.

### Story: The Boatman and the Philosopher
Long ago, a learned Hindu philosopher who was thoroughly but theoretically versed in the four vast Hindu bibles, wanted to cross to the other side of the holy Ganges River in India. He engaged a lone boatman to carry him across in a rowboat. The proud Hindu philosopher, knower of the four Hindu bibles, finding nothing to occupy his mind, wanted to show off his knowledge to the boatman.

With this goal in mind, the Hindu philosopher asked, “Boatman, have you studied the first Hindu bible?” The boatman replied, “No sir. I don’t know anything about the first Hindu bible.” The Hindu philosopher, looking very wise, remarked pityingly, “Mr. Boatman, I am sorry to declare unto you that 25 per cent of your life is lost.”

The boatman swallowed this insult and kept on quietly rowing his boat. When the boat had gone some distance across the Ganges, the Hindu philosopher, his eyes sparkling with unholy wisdom, exclaimed loudly, “Mr. Boatman, I must ask you: have you studied the second Hindu bible?”

This question roused the boatman and he replied, “Sir, I tell you definitely that I know nothing about the second Hindu bible.” To this the Hindu philosopher replied with cool amusement, “Mr. Boatman, I am very sorry to declare unto you that 50 per cent of your life is lost.”

The boatman angrily settled down to his work at the oars. When the boat had reached the middle of the river and the wind was blowing a bit strongly, for the third time the Hindu philosopher’s eyes glistened with superiority and he demanded, “Mr. Boatman tell me: have you studied the third Hindu bible?”

By this time the boatman was beside himself with wrath and he shouted, “Mr. Philosopher, I am sorry you cannot find anybody else to practice your knowledge upon. I told you I don’t know anything about the Hindu bibles.”

The philosopher, in gloating triumph and with pseudo-wisdom resounding in his voice, declared nonchalantly, “Mr. Boatman, I am sorry to announce unto you that 75 per cent of your life is lost.” The boatman kept mumbling and somehow swallowed the words of this impossible philosopher.

Ten more minutes passed. Suddenly a demon of a storm seared the veils of the clouds and sprang over the waters of the river, lashing it into furiously excited waves. The boat began to rock like a little floating leaf in the madly raging river current.

The philosopher was shivering and trembling, while the boatman with a smile of assurance on his face looked at him and said, “Mr. Philosopher, you pelted me with many questions. May I now ask you one?” Receiving an affirmative reply, the boatman said, “Mr. Hindu Philosopher, knower of the four Hindu bibles, you established that 75 per cent of my life was lost. Now I will ask you a question: Do you know how to swim?”

To this question the Hindu philosopher tremblingly replied, “No, dear boatman. I cannot swim.” Then the boatman, with victorious indifference, smilingly replied, “Mr. Hindu Philosopher, knower of the four Hindu bibles, I am sorry to declare unto you that 100 per cent of your life is soon going to be lost.”

Just at that moment, as if fulfilling the prophecy of the boatman, a furious gust upset the boat, drowning the philosopher. The boatman, by powerful strokes, overcame the waves and reached the shores of the Ganges in safety.

******

The moral of this story: No matter how prosperous or powerful you are, unless you learn the art of right behavior and right living, you will drown in the seas of difficulty. But if you know the art of swimming across life’s tumultuous river by initiating the right actions at the right time, with powerful strokes of will power, you will be able to transcend the tests of life and reach the shores of perfect contentment.

**Take Away from the class:** 
- ***On the mountain peaks of pride, the mercy rains of God cannot gather; but they readily collect in the valley of humbleness***.
- Humbleness is quality of soul. Pride is blinding. It shuts out the vision of the Infinite and greater souls around us. 
- An egoistic person is centered around itself, humble people always think about others. They put themselves in shoes of others and have higher level of empathy. 
- An egotistical person is not ready to learn. A humble person is always ready to learn. 
- Egotistical person repels others. Humility attracts others. Humble people are more listening and receptive to other's thoughts and ideas. 
- When we know we know less, we respect others and be kind to everyone. 
- Whatever qualities and skills you possess, offer these to Lord. Since these have come from life energy. Remember this: Thou is the doer and not I. Thy will be done not mine. Its the life energy that is actually doing. But ego makes us think that we are the doer. 
- Self-Respect is different from pride. Self-Respect comes from self-awareness and right awareness. Take more feedback from others regarding qualities that you want to be proud of for yourself. But do not lose your guards and keep learning and growing more. 

Jai Guru !!
