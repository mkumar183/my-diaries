you dont always solve a problem using 
technology. you first solve 
the problem then find a way 
to scale it through technology. 

technology is a tool not a solution. 

most leaders are going wrong in asking 
their people to find solution using AI.
they should first ask their people 
to find problems amd then see if AI 
can help solve it quicker or better.
