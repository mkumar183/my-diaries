**Problem Statement:** 
AI is new and there is lot of hyp. and leaders are making many decisions based on this hyp and industry is in a churn. 

Problem deep dive: 
There are so many use cases. 
At times, leaders do not differentiate difference between gen-AI and traditional AIML. 
less understanding of what AI can do and what it cannot. 
general hyp around AI can do anything and everything. 
There is a fear among people of losing jobs and become irrelevant 
Companies are firing mindlessly thinking the whole industry will shrink. There may be some truth to it but lets understand we are in hyp cycle of this technology. 
Companies are mindlessly changing their roadmap towards "how to use gen-AI" vs "what problems of my customers i use easily using gen-AI". 

**Impact**: This can provide some relief to audience that AI is not going to take away all jobs. Provide some points to be more useful, relevant and productive. Can also give direction to leaders as how to go slow, assess the situation and make more wise and long term strategic decisions. 

**Target Audience:** Engineering Leaders and Technical workforce.
