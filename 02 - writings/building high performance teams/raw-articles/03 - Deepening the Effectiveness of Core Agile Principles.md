### Deepening the impact of core 12 Agile Principals 

I've often noticed that while many organizations claim to be using Agile, they are mostly adopting the mechanics of Agile without embracing its core principles and philosophy. Over time, the essence of Agile tends to be overshadowed by procedural adherence, often relegated to training sessions and academic discussions.

I have found it extremely useful to gather teams and walk them through the core principles of Agile, reviewing together how well these principles are being integrated into their work. These principles are not mere mechanics but foundational philosophies that establish a culture of empowerment and trust within teams. Achieving this alignment requires real leadership within the organization to empower teams to embody these principles in their daily work.

To build a high-performance team, it is crucial to ensure that every team member deeply understands and embodies the core principles of Agile and Scrum. Begin by reviewing the key principles and then engage the team in an active assessment of their current adherence to these principles. This process will help identify areas for improvement and foster a stronger, more principled approach to Agile practices.

12 Agile principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto:

1. **Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery**: Deliver valuable software to customers frequently, with a preference for shorter timescales.

2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development**: Embrace changes in requirements to provide customers with a competitive advantage.

3. **Deliver working software frequently, with a preference for shorter timescales**: Aim to deliver functional software at regular intervals, typically ranging from a few weeks to a few months.

4. **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project**: Foster collaboration between business stakeholders and development teams throughout the project lifecycle.

5. **Build projects around motivated individuals, giving them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done**: Empower and support motivated individuals by providing them with the necessary resources, autonomy, and trust to achieve project goals.

6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation**: Prioritize face-to-face communication as the most effective means of conveying information within the team and with stakeholders.

7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress**: Focus on delivering functional software as the primary indicator of project progress and success.

8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development**: Foster a sustainable pace of work that promotes long-term productivity and team well-being.

9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility**: Emphasize the importance of technical excellence and good design practices to maintain agility and facilitate future changes.

10. **Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential**: Strive for simplicity by minimizing unnecessary work and complexity, focusing on delivering value efficiently.

11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams**: Allow self-organizing teams to collaboratively determine the best approaches to architecture, requirements, and design based on their collective expertise and experience.

12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly**: Facilitate regular reflections and continuous improvement within the team, encouraging them to identify areas for improvement and adjust their processes accordingly.

This survey can be distributed to team members to gather their feedback on the team's practices related to Agile principles.

Few instances where this survey has been able to help me identify problems in areas like customer collaboration, self-organization and make teams discuss upon which could be one of these problem that they would like to focus upon to resolve it. 

- Which principle does your team perform best at? (Select one)
    
    -  Customer satisfaction through continuous delivery
    -  Welcoming changing requirements
    -  Collaboration between business and developers
    -  Sustainable development
    -  Empirical process control
    -  Self-organizing teams
    -  Collaboration
    -  Value-based prioritization
    -  Time-boxing
    -  Continuous attention to technical excellence
    -  Simplicity
    -  Regular reflection and adjustment

- Which principle would benefit your team the most if improved? (Select one)
    
    -  Customer satisfaction through continuous delivery
    -  Welcoming changing requirements
    -  Collaboration between business and developers
    -  Sustainable development
    -  Empirical process control
    -  Self-organizing teams
    -  Collaboration
    -  Value-based prioritization
    -  Time-boxing
    -  Continuous attention to technical excellence
    -  Simplicity
    -  Regular reflection and adjustment

Areas that have emerged from these discussions are different for different team. But in my case we could work on self-organizing teams, collaboration, attention to technical excellence and Simplicity. This framework has proven very well in bringing dev, qa and product owners as well at times and let them reflect on basics of Agile.
