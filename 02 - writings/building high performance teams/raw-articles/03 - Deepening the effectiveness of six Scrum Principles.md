Agile and Scrum principles both aim to improve software development process. While Agile principles come from Agile Agile Manifesto, which is a broader framework applicable to various methodologies, including Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and others.

Scrum principles are specific to the Scrum framework, which is a type of Agile methodology. Scrum is a structured framework for managing complex projects, particularly in software development.

**Focus**: Scrum principles are more prescriptive and provide a detailed approach to implementing Agile values through defined roles, events, and artifacts. They focus on iterative development, transparency, and continuous improvement within the Scrum framework.

Periodically running teams via Scrum Principles or Agile depending upon what agile methodology your teams use can be helpful in gaining insight at strengths and weakness of your team w.r.t. these principles. 

### Key Scrum Principles with Descriptions and Discussion Questions

1. **Empirical Process Control**
   - **Description**: Scrum relies on the three pillars of empirical process control: transparency, inspection, and adaptation. These principles help manage work and processes by making information visible, regularly inspecting the current state, and adapting based on findings.
   - **Discussion Questions**:
     - How do we ensure transparency in our work processes and outcomes?
     - What mechanisms do we have in place for regular inspection of our work?
     - How do we adapt our processes based on feedback from inspections?

2. **Self-Organizing Teams**
   - **Description**: Scrum teams are self-organizing, meaning they decide how best to accomplish their work rather than being directed by others outside the team. This promotes ownership, accountability, and creativity.
   - **Discussion Questions**:
     - How does our team organize its work without external direction?
     - In what ways do we take ownership of our tasks and responsibilities?
     - What challenges do we face in being a self-organizing team?

3. **Collaboration**
   - **Description**: Collaboration is at the heart of Scrum. It involves working together to achieve shared goals and leveraging the collective intelligence of the team to solve problems and deliver value. Collaboration extends to stakeholders as well.
   - **Discussion Questions**:
     - How effectively do we collaborate within our team and with external stakeholders?
     - What practices do we follow to ensure effective collaboration?
     - Are there any barriers to collaboration that we need to address?

4. **Value-Based Prioritization**
   - **Description**: Scrum prioritizes work based on the value it delivers to the customer and stakeholders. This ensures that the most important and valuable work is done first, maximizing the return on investment.
   - **Discussion Questions**:
     - How do we determine the value of different tasks and features?
     - What criteria do we use to prioritize our work?
     - How can we improve our prioritization process to deliver more value?

5. **Time-Boxing**
   - **Description**: Scrum uses fixed time periods, or time-boxes, for activities such as sprints, daily scrums, and reviews. This creates a predictable rhythm, encourages focus, and ensures regular delivery of work.
   - **Discussion Questions**:
     - How well do we adhere to our time-boxed activities?
     - What benefits have we seen from time-boxing our work?
     - Are there any time-boxed activities that we struggle to maintain?

6. **Iterative Development**
   - **Description**: Scrum promotes iterative development, where the product is built incrementally in small, usable increments. This approach allows for frequent delivery of value and regular feedback, which can be incorporated into the ongoing development process.
   - **Discussion Questions**:
     - How do we break down our work into small, manageable increments?
     - What is our process for delivering increments of value regularly?
     - How do we incorporate feedback into our iterative development process?

These six principles are fundamental to the Scrum framework, guiding teams in managing their work effectively, collaborating efficiently, and continuously delivering value. Use these discussion questions to explore how well your team is adhering to these principles and identify areas for improvement.

Identify one principle that is strength of this team and identify one where team can improve upon and have some action items towards the same. 

Key issues i have found with some of the teams i worked with are around Self-organizing teams and Collaboration and taking some action items towards improvements in these area has lead to great results. E.g. Team did not have a clear understanding of what is collaboration. When we asked like how many decisions are taken with inputs from more than two people and what kind of such decision team has taken team figured out they need better mechanism to write down such thoughts prior to discussion. This brought us culture of writing technical spikes and technical designs which multiple members of teams will review and then they will have discussion prior to making a decision. 

These small yet important cultural changes result in teams becoming high-performing teams in longer run.
