Introduction:

**Hook:** 
We all have heard that culture of an organization is what determines its growth. Its the primary driver of any organization growth. An organization with right culture can navigate through all kind of business challenges while an organization with bad culture will eventually end up drowning itself against its competition even if it has significant advantage against others. 

**Problem Statement:** 
Organization culture is what defines an organization. Leaders do not understand that does a good culture entails and what steps are required to build a great culture consciously. In this article we will explore what makes good culture in the context of an high performing engineering organization. While many of the aspects would be common to other industries, there would be few that are closest to software development process. 

##### What: Understand the problem
Leaders are busy driving the business results since that's what they are measured on day to day. Culture is something that provides sustained growth. Also, when culture is good then things are continuously improving and getting better. Business results in that case becomes the job of directing the efforts in right direction by leaders. However, when basic culture of an organization is not right then organization is missing the right kind of life energy. 
Just like our body and minds are fueled by life energy supply that we get by keeping our body and mind in good condition, an organization draws its life energy through its culture. As the culture starts drowning the life energy starts to get withdrawn and now navigating business results through the system start becoming harder and harder. Leaders are now struggling and trying to understand reasons behind this lack of energy and coordination in their organization and in fact in such cases the whole organization ends up struggling. 

**Impact:**  Impact of having bad culture can be very high however very hard to quantify. You will find that overall organization is struggling. Its not able to come up with right kind of innovations. Its customers are dissatisfied. And products are not getting better. At times organizations will find thousands of engineers working yet no or very little needle moving impact its able to create. Your competition is able to do much more with much less resources and is constantly eating into your market space. A company with good culture finds that things are automatically and seamlessly working. Leaders have to put very minimal impact in terms of ensuring that there is good alignment in teams and its people with markets and customers. As their employees get this connection they figure out the right solutions and are able to implement fast and make their customers happy. The products are growing and there are probably scaling challenges which also its employees are able to find solution quickly enough. Where there is good culture, there is high trust and empowerment in the system and leaders are almost obsolete from day to day tactical work. 

Target Audience: 
This article is meant for engineering leaders specifically in software industry. 

**Why**
**Rationale**: A solution is needed in order to make the organization long sustainable growth. A bad culture will make its good people leave the organization soon and its competitor being able to provide much better offerings to its customers slowly stealing away business from the company. Building right culture is strategic move and it requires long term strategy and actions. Actions taken today will yield results in months and years at times. 
Benefits & Goal: Increase in productivity. Improvements in customer CSATs. Company being able to beat its competition and win more sales. Its employees are happy, attrition is low and overall costs of building and managing systems is controlled. 

**How: the solution**
**Proposed Solution:** Understanding what is good engineering culture. 

**Organization Culture:** 
Organization culture at a broader definition means the set of behaviours its members exhibit for getting things done and interacting with each other. These behaviors could be as simple as how do you greet a person in an alley to how managers assign tasks to their people and how they take status and how they react when something goes wrong or how they appreciate their employees. So culture is a set of behaviors exhibited by its members. 

**Engineering Culture:** 
In the above context when we talk about engineering culture in a software development organization it then refers to set of processes and interactions that happen in its engineering teams in order to get the work done. To be more specific organizations how does your SDLC really work and how your members interact with each other during these processes. e.g. how are the requirements created. How prioritization is done. Who is responsible for it. How its member deal with conflicting priorities and multiple stakeholder interests. How the work moves from one stage to another stage and what are the interactions and feelings associated during these movements. Do team really work as a team or as individuals. Are there lot of frictions or does team come together for achieving certain objectives collectively. How all of this is organized and orchestrated within an organization is what determines the cultures.
