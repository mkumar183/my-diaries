In this article i want to distinguish Integrity from Performance. What I want to convey is that Integrity is not a performance parameter. If you draw Performance and Integrity on X and Y axis of a chart then we get four different quardants. 

Q1 - Low Integrity Low Performance 
Q2 - Low Integrity High Performance 
Q3 - High Integrity Low Performance 
Q4 - High Integrity High Performance 

I want to convey that people in your team belonging to Q2 (Low Integrity, High Performance) are the ones that are most dangerous. These are the folks who can do significant damage to your organizations. These are the people who will win your trust and will never let you have questions since their performance is always good, at least on the face of it. These may be people who are very good at showcasing work done by many other people in your teams as their own work and taking credit. These are the people who demotivate many other people belonging to other people. 
While you may think they are highest performing people, these people may actually on the ground may have deviced strategies where they are actually not performing rather they are simply able to showcase good results to you with some quick wins. They are always on the forefront of most critical tasks and even forfronting customers. These people have earned your trust. Not only these people can be dangerous to your organization but also they can harm you significantly when situation arise. 

Leaders might think Low Integrity and Low Performance people are the ones that should be the ones to be discarded first. However, i like to bring a different perspective here. More often than not 


Integrity is not binary, Its Spectrum. 
Just like most other qualities, Integrity isn't binary. You will not get 100% honest and high integrity people vs totally dishonet ones. You will always have a mix. Its upto you to establish a system where Integrity is rewarded and dishonesty is not encouraged or sabotaged. To me, this is where data plays a crucial role for me. E.g. I do not like to have status meetings with PPTs prepared by leads. One its a sheer waste of time in today's world when you can have access to most data, second which is more important is that you are giving a chance to your leads and managers present anything to you which is not backed by data. 
Dishonesty does not start in bulk. Its seeps in slowly. Initially people make up smaller lies to you. They see that they are able to pass through these lies and win your trust. Over a period of time their lies start getting bigger and bigger. If you are a leader which is away from code and realities of the world, they will take full advantage of these situations. 
This is beginning of a toxic environment. People with high integrity, in such an environment starts taking a back seat. In fact many of them will leave your organization as well. They will be demotivated. They are not very good at presenting lies to you. 


Tools to detect low Integrity.


Believing in Data. Stop having Status Meetings with PPTs. Get Status reports thru automation. 


Do not build a system where people can fool you with wrong results and establish a strong connection. Its a habit that seeps into people over a period of time. 


Over a period of time when people know they cannot fool you, they start to behave honestly. Also, by you providing a safe environment and allowing people to fail and make mistakes, fosters a cultuer where everyone feels comfortable. Now when the picture is clear to you as who is performing and who is not and things are transparent, you as a leader can start working on improving the performance. 

You will be astonished when low performing people are able to open up with a high safe environment and they have no other route available but to learn from their team members, how quickly they are able to leave their old habits of lying and cheating but start focusing on learning. As they experience that you as a leader are observing and are appreciating their small successes, now their behavior starts to change. They start building higher confidence. They start to learn and now they start falling into bracket of High Integrity High Performance. 


Take Away: 
- Never tolerate low Integrity behavior (Dishonesty, Lies, Deceits)
- Rely on Data to tell you the truth 
- Ask questions when there is a difference in what you hear from your teams vs what data tells you 
- Let people know that you know the truth. 
- Reward Integrity first and then comes performance.
