What is architecture when it comes to software systems. 

Depending upon kind of system you are building, it can be very vast or something simple. Essentially software architecture deals with building blocks of the system on which the whole system will stand. 

scalability and volatility. 

key pieces of infrastructure. 

Comparing to physical world, think of architecture of a city, a small colony, an apartment complex or a house. Each of these will require an architecture to start with. However, in each of these you are dealing at different scale. Likewise when you build software systems you have to understand what are you building and for who. And how this will scale and evolve over a period of time. 

Every application/system evolves. Architectures keep in mind and have a solid understanding of how a particular system will evolve. 

Architects need to understand business ask/model and vision. Without which architects can be failure. 

Architecture needs to be broken down in smaller pieces so that there is a clear sense of integration and responsibility of each component of the architecture. Now we have to apply as the system evolves and scales how each component will be impacted and can each component itself be scaled with whole system evolving. 

While designing a city, it has to be thought of how many people that city will accomodate to start with and then how that number will grow. As this number grows how the city will accomodate more people without breaking the basic parameters of the city requirements. If these things are not thought through then cities will get into a mess which is what is happening around the world. Since there is no one person owning the architecture of the city. 

Concerns of Software Architect: 
In case of cities, first it has to be looked upon which land that city will be built on. Does that city has supply of basic elements such as water, food and other materials that it will need to bring from outside world. How this city will be connected with rest of the world and what will be the cost of transporting things in and out of the city. 

It has to be thought through how the city will sustain. e.g. what would be the key exports of the city and then what all it will need to import. Will the city be able to export enough that it will have money to import what it will need ? These are key interfaces of the city. 

In case city has good natural resources then we know that sooner or later the city will end up thriving. If a government decides to invest in building the city and give it initial investment in how much time that investment will be returned in form of taxes and revenues. 

These are basic financial viability of the city itself. In a similar manner when designing software we have to ask questions, what 'services' this software will provide. Who will it provide these services to. What is the investment required to build those basic services. 

Drawing a parallel with building a city gives a good view point to software architects since city is a physical entity so things can be tangibly felt in this. Though every analogy has its limitation. 

There are multiple ways of building a city. One is do a very large set of investment and build all infrastructure required for initial one million people to live which includes roads, transports, building, water supply, food supply etc. This is software world we called a big bang approach. 

Another approach to building a city could be to make it livable just for 100 or 1000 people. Entice these people to come and live there and enjoy those benefits. Using these smaller set of people try to do prototypes and build a model where it starts giving you some ROI. Now as per the plan start expanding it by 1000 more people. 

In software world when we talk of agile, we talk of this second approach. However, if you think about it, this requires a vision and a plan behind upcoming of the city. In case there is no architecture or vision, you will find that the city has become a mess soon and is causing lot more pain than pleasure. Also, it may end up giving losses such that goverment has to invest lot more than the taxes it can reap from it. 

Since this thought process is kept and people move in and out and things are developed in hurry, companies very soon find that their softwares are no more changeable. These are very hard to maintain since as the system expands, people start adding code recklessly to it and software requires huge amount of maintenance. 

Role of an Architect is really to govern this growth or change of the software. Understand growing needs of the organisation and customers and suggests changes to the software that keep it up-to-date and relevant to the future changes. 

In addition to these changes, there are other changes such as changes in technologies, more services become available, more new tools become available, security vulnerability all these changes have to be accomodated in the existing softwares. And so, there is needed an architect who has this whole context and can guide teams towards sustainable growth and development of product and services. 


Accountabilities of Architect:
- How easily we can scale the software 
- How easily application can be enhanced for new features 
- How easy is it to maintain the current application and its customers
- How easy is it to uptake technology changes, security vulnerabilies in the system
