A need and foundation for High Performance Agile Software Teams is Leadership Transition from Authoritative, Traditional Leadership Mindset to More Collaborative and Inclusive Leadership. Ability to let go of control. This requires cultivating Humility, Focus on outcomes and not the process, Flexibility where you let teams function in timeboxes and spending more time on observing the system and teams as opposed to directing the teams. You need to cultivate Coach mindset and get away from commanding tendencies. 

Leaders need to create an environment where its safe to fail. 

These are soft aspects of Agile, Collaborative Leadership which are essential and a foundation for starting the journey of High-Performance teams for highly Innovative work where tasks are not repetitive and cannot be directed from top as is and more knowledge workers are involved. 

Transitioning from Traditional Authoritative Leadership to Agile Leadership 
Collaborative Leadership

collaboration, continuous improvement, and responding to change.

### Glossary of Agile Methodology and Principles

#### Key Terms and Concepts

1. **Agile**: A methodology and mindset promoting iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility to respond to change.

2. **Scrum**: A specific Agile framework for managing work with an emphasis on collaboration, accountability, and iterative progress towards a well-defined goal.

3. **Sprint**: A set period (usually 2-4 weeks) during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review.

4. **Scrum Master**: A facilitator for an Agile development team, responsible for removing obstacles to the team's progress and ensuring Scrum practices are followed.

5. **Product Owner**: A role in Scrum responsible for defining user stories and prioritizing the backlog to streamline the execution of program priorities.

6. **Development Team**: A group of professionals who work together to deliver the product increments.

7. **User Story**: A simple description of a software feature from an end-user perspective.

8. **Backlog**: An ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product, with the most important items at the top.

9. **Epic**: A large user story that is too big to be completed in a single sprint and is broken down into smaller stories.

10. **Increment**: A functional, testable, and potentially releasable piece of the product.

11. **Velocity**: A measure of the amount of work a team can complete in a single sprint, used for planning future sprints.

12. **Burndown Chart**: A graphical representation of work left to do versus time, used to track progress within a sprint.

13. **Daily Standup**: A short daily meeting where team members synchronize their activities and plan for the next 24 hours.

14. **Retrospective**: A meeting held at the end of a sprint to reflect on the process and identify areas for improvement.

15. **Sprint Review**: A meeting held at the end of a sprint to review the work completed and the backlog, and to demonstrate the product increment to stakeholders.

16. **Sprint Planning**: A meeting at the beginning of a sprint where the team selects items from the backlog to work on during the sprint.

17. **Kanban**: An Agile framework focusing on visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and managing flow to improve process efficiency.

18. **Lean**: A methodology aimed at minimizing waste and maximizing value, often used in conjunction with Agile practices.

19. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A practice where code changes are automatically tested and merged into a shared repository frequently.

20. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: A practice where code changes are automatically tested and prepared for release to production.

21. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: The simplest version of a product that can be released to validate a concept and gather user feedback.

22. **Definition of Done (DoD)**: A shared understanding of what it means for work to be considered complete.

23. **Agile Manifesto**: A foundational document outlining the values and principles of Agile software development.

24. **Servant Leadership**: A leadership philosophy where the leaderâ€™s main goal is to serve the team, facilitating their ability to work effectively.

25. **Cross-functional Team**: A team composed of members with different functional expertise working towards a common goal.

26. **Time-boxing**: Allocating a fixed time period to an activity, ensuring it does not overrun.

27. **Empirical Process Control**: A principle emphasizing making decisions based on observation, experience, and experimentation.

28. **Incremental Development**: A process where the product is built, delivered, and improved in small, manageable increments.

29. **Iterative Development**: A process where the product is built through repeated cycles (iterations), allowing for continuous improvement based on feedback.

30. **Collaboration**: Working together across various roles and departments to achieve a common goal, a core aspect of Agile.

31. **Transparency**: Ensuring all aspects of the development process are visible to those responsible for the outcome.

32. **Inspection**: Regularly checking the progress towards the goal to detect variances and problems.

33. **Adaptation**: Adjusting processes and plans in response to inspection findings to ensure continuous improvement.

34. **Fail Fast**: A principle advocating quick iterations to identify and address failures early in the development process.

35. **Feedback Loop**: A system where the output of a process is fed back into the system as input to improve future outcomes.

### Agile Principles (from the Agile Manifesto)

1. **Customer Satisfaction through Continuous Delivery**
2. **Welcome Changing Requirements**
3. **Frequent Delivery of Working Software**
4. **Close, Daily Cooperation between Business People and Developers**
5. **Motivated Individuals**
6. **Face-to-Face Conversation**
7. **Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress**
8. **Sustainable Development**
9. **Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence and Good Design**
10. **Simplicity**
11. **Self-Organizing Teams**
12. **Regular Reflection and Adjustment**

Principles that constitute an Agile Culture: 
- Decentralisation of Power
- Safe Environment 
- Embracing Failure, Inspiring Growth: Building Trust and Improvement 
- 
### Scrum Principles

1. **Empirical Process Control**: Transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
2. **Self-Organizing Teams**: Teams decide how to accomplish their work.
3. **Collaboration**: Interaction between team members and stakeholders.
4. **Value-Based Prioritization**: Focus on delivering the highest value features first.
5. **Time-Boxing**: Fixed time periods for activities.
6. **Iterative Development**: Repeated cycles to improve product and process.
