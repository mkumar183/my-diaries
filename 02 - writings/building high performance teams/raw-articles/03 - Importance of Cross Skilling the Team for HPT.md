## Importance of Cross Skilling in a Cross Functional High Performance Team 

In my previous articles, we talked about importance of cross functional teams as a foundation for building high performance teams. We also took inspirations from a cricket team as how a cricket team represent a well groomed cross functional team and how we can learn this and use these learnings in an agile scrum team. 

In this article, i like to take this concept further and talk about how a good cross functional team presents opportunities as well as need of cross skilled individuals and how this can really help leaders elevate the performance of such teams. Even here a cricket or any other sports team provides a good example and inspirations to borrow from. 

In a cross functional team you bring together different skills that are part of different functions together as a team under a unified leadership of a captain or scrum master. This now presents a unique opportunity for you to be able to cross skill your team players. A scrum team is responsible for building new features which require multiple skills to come together. A product owner, UI/UX, fronend development, backend, testing, devOps, SQL, databases, dockers, kubernetes, helm charts etc. On an average you may need some 10+ skills coming together delivering these features depending upon complexity of your application and business. 

In these scenarios how you cross train your team members can highly impact performance of your team. You have to have a good understanding of these skill mixes, interests of the team members and how can team support each other in case of emergencies. E.g. your team should be structured such that if any one to two members if they are not available for 1-2 weeks team can still function with reduced capacity but can still deliver end to end features. 


I-shaped teams where each individual is very deep skilled in only one skill. In a T-shaped team, individuals are very deep in one skill however, they can do manageable work in other skills. 

This provides a very good mechanism for teams to balance and not have rigid dependencies on any one individual. 

An example is if your frontend team member has to take some time off for 1 week, and if your stories are having some front end and backend work then all the stories will be delayed. however, in case one individual can also do some front end work then in these kind of situations they may take little more time but get some stories completed end to end. 

In many teams, testers are bottle necks. And so, testing is one skill that every individual should be able to do though an experienced tester brings to the team various scenarios that developers may otherwise miss. 

### Challenges of cross skilling your team members 
Some times engineers or individuals are not prepared to learn multiple skills. However, in case software development work, its very good for engineers to know multiple technologies. Leaders should coach and mentor their team members so that they are motivated to learn multiple skills. 

*Patience*: When you want your teams to be cross skilled you will need to be patient. Since when they are developing new skills they will be slow. Even though you have an experienced member who can get the same thing done faster. However, having this patience and treating this cross skilling as an investment can help you reap its benefits in longer run. 

*Engineers are more selleable*: A cross skilled engineer has higher market value. So the chances are when you have cross skilled members, they can easily grab another better offer and desert you. For this, you should remember its your investment in your people. You need to create the right culture and sell this culture to your team members so that they understand the importance of it and they do not want to leave for a petty increase or a petty reason. You need to hold your people with your team culture as best selling point. 

*May reduce need of collaboration*: I think this is more of a myth. Yes, it can happen when everyone can do everything then they do not need each other. However, you need to ensure that in your teams, people are doing code review of each others. There is sense of shared responsibility towards delivered features to customers and team members are having higher reviews among themselves for tickets and design documents to have high collaboration among themselves. 

highlight any other challenges of it pls. 
### A good cross skilled cricket team example. 
In a good cricket team there are specialized batsmen. However, most of them can do bowling and all of them have to do fielding. Developing few batsmen as good fielders and investing on their training can help the team tremendously. Likewise, in case each of the bowler can also improve their batting this can be a huge plus for the team. 

Few examples are all rounders are: Kapil Dev and ... who have made huge difference to team victories. A player like jonty rodes with special fielding skills plus bowling and batting is also a good plus. recently australian player who scored 200 runs who was not even a batsman and took the team to victory is another example. So please add some examples in this article.
