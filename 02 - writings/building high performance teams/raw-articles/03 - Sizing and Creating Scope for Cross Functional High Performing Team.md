In my previous articles we discussed how structuring your teams for building agile software applications is setting foundation for building high performing teams. Building high performing teams is a journey and not something that can be done in a short time. It would require leaders to experiment with many adjustments just like we discussed in our previous articles you would see adjustments required to a sports team. 

However, one question may arise. What is the ideal size of a cross-functional team. Who all should be part of this team and how to create scope or a charter for these teams especially in a large organization or as the organization grow. 

In this article we will discuss some of these aspects. As to what all entails in structuring teams and groups within an organization. 

### Terminologies
We will use terminology of an Organization, Groups and Teams. An Organization is the complete organization which may be composed of one single application or may have multiple software applications that it caters to its customers. A group is a set of Teams working on a given application or a sub-group of applications. 

### Skills and Departments Involved
Typically to build and support a software application you need product management which thinks about the requirements and features to be built, engineering which writes the code and builds the software, testers if you consider it as different from engineering, cloudops who are responsible for deploying and managing the application in the cloud, support that takes issues from customers and solves it and services which is involved in doing customizations for its customers. 

### Organization Context
Each organization is different in the sense that it manages different types of applications, projects, customers. e.g. an organization may be dealing with B2B applications vs handling B2C application. An organization taking large projects from customers and delivering it vs organizations providing SaaS based applications that are long running. In order to make our example simple, we will take a case where an organization is building SaaS based applications in a B2B environment. In this case the organization supports multiple different distinct applications for a similar customer base.
