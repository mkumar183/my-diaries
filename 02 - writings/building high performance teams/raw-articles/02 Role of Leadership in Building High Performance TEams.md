High performance teams are not created by chance or accident. Its built by Leaders with the right Intent. 

There are predominantly two qualities required in leadership in order to foster high performance teams. 

1. Humility (Absence of Ego)
2. Passion (Strong desire to build HPTs)

High Performance Teams thrive on a high performance culture and this culture is built by a leadership team that believes in certain principles that align with Agile Principles. 

HPTs require a particular environment to thrive. These require high empowerment. High empowerment coupled with Trust in teams that teams will attempt to do the right things. 

Teams cannot be empowered just by words or intentions. Empowerment requires a particular environment fostered by an organization structure that facilitates teams to be empowered. 

E.g. if Teams do not have clear goals and all the tools required to achieve these goals then teams cannot be empowered. In case teams cannot make mistakes and learn from these mistakes then teams are not empowered. 

In order to create high performance teams, teams needs to be structured such that teams can directly make impact to their customers without having too many middle mans or teams in between. 

This is why a cross-functional structure of teams where each team is empowered to directly make difference to specific type of experiences for its customers is so crucial for a high performance team to thrive. 

Leaders who intend to build high performance teams, create an organization structure where teams are cross-functional even if there are departments and skill based hierarchies. 

Once cross functional structure is in place, leadership carefully crafts the roles and responsibilities of these teams in such a way that teams can directly impact customer experiences. 

This requires deeper understanding of the systems and applications teams are building. It also requires effort to keep the systems very simple. 

Cross-functional structure with high empowerment becomes complex as the teams, customers and features that applications support starts to grow. 

This is where leadership needs to bring in right senior resources at right time who can keep the system simple and control how the whole system scales over a period of time. 

Role of leadership is crucial. Leadership need to be highly connected with busienss, product, technologies and people. Leadership need to make smart and timely decisions such that teams can operate with high level of freedom and liberty and empowerment and trust. 

Role of leadership in such an organization truely reflects that of 'Servent Leadership'. They are all the time serving teams ensuring that teams have all that they need to remain highly productive. They ensure teams can not only build but also observe their code in production and then receive feedback from their customers and then are empowered to decide how to improve their customer experiences. 

Leaders in such an environment are highly connected. They are always observing closely and guiding 'invisibly' without coming in the way of the teams. They are constantly facilitating teams or we can say Serving the teams. 

If you are part of a high performing happy team, count your blessing since much of what your leadership is doing amy not be visible to you.
