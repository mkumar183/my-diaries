Its a main source of communication today. Groups of people coming together discussing ideas, brainstorming. Provides easy way to do asynchronous communication. 

How to Organize these channels so that its easy for people to know which channel to use for what purpose. Reduces confusion and helps people know have right discussion in the right channel. 

It can create efficiencies and effectiveness in the groups. There is not a single way to categorize these channels and groups. However, I am proposing something here on which we can discuss, brainstorm and then finalize the structure. 

suggestions for channel categories: 
1. Team Channels (These channels could use a naming convention of insights-team-<team-name>) Anything required from team any new requirement can go to this channel and also team can communicate through this channel within its members. 
2. Certain Group Channels : Such as leadership channel where all leaders are. Managers channel where all managers all. 
3. Cross-Team-Collaboration Channels: Engineering to SRT, Engineering to Onboarding, Engineering to Services and Support Channels. These are the channels where these various groups can interact with each others. 
4. Specific Initiative Channels: These are channels for specific initiatives such as a particular project such as onboarding montana customer. Any 'project' that is spanning across multiple teams if it needs a channel we can use it. 

Based on these categories I am categorizing existing channels in a category and recommending a new name and channel type for it. Please review and provide your suggestion on the same.
