Culture can be defined as a "common set of behaviors" that a "group of people" displays. 

These behaviors are established consciously or unconsciously by people and environment through approval and disapproval system. 

When certain behaviors are approved regularly by members of a group such behaviors percolate down in the people more.

Behaviours that are disapproved by members of the group are the behaviors that group refrains from. 

Leadership team has the highest influence over these set of behaviors.

An organisation can have a culture, within organisation different groups can different culture (thought they may still some common behaviors across the group each group can have distinct set of behaviors that distinguish each group). like wise each team can display some unique behaviors and some common ones pertaining to group and the whole organisation.

In order to control these behaviors consciously the leadership defines a set of values. Which leaders of the company are supposed to adhere to. Purpose is a larger objective which when is clear drives additional guidance towards these behaviors. 

Behaviours are contextual. In certain group, at certain time, in certain situation certain behaviors are accepted while the same behaviors in a different setting can invite scorn. So people are always cautious about not displaying set of behaviors that can invite more scorn but more acceptance. These are very very deeply ingrained in individuals and can sometimes take long period of time to change these. 

As people get more experienced more older their ability to change these behaviors may go down while some may be more adaptable. Each individuals may inherit a set of behaviors from its own surrounding like family, cast, geography etc. 

A leaders job is to effectively communicate the common values, shared goals, objectives and a sense of purpose that will now drive these behaviours in such a way that it leads the whole group to be able to compete with other groups of people (their competitors). How well one group is aligned to compete with their competition decides if a company is going to be able to beat its competitors and be able to survive or not.

Cultures are percolated down into people via defining a set of values, a clearly defined purpose for organisation that includes its people and then constantly rewarding the positive or behaviors that are aligned with these values and purpose. At times, a scorn may be required for opposite behavior traits but that should be occassional. 

Research says an organisation that has a culture conducive to its growth ends up delivering twice the revenue growth than the companies that don't.

Stories of Culture change: 
In the bustling heart of San Francisco's tech scene, amidst the towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, a revolution was quietly unfolding within the walls of Salesforce Tower. At the helm of this transformation stood a visionary leader, Marc Benioff, whose unyielding commitment to culture change would redefine not just his company, but the very fabric of corporate America.

As the founder and CEO of Salesforce, Benioff had always been driven by a sense of purpose beyond profits. He believed that businesses could be a force for good in the world, and he set out to prove it. From the company's inception, Benioff instilled a culture of innovation, equality, and philanthropy, setting the stage for a remarkable journey of transformation.

Under Benioff's leadership, Salesforce became more than just a software company—it became a movement. He understood that culture change begins with a strong set of values, so he made trust, customer success, and equality the cornerstones of Salesforce's culture. But Benioff didn't just pay lip service to these values; he embodied them in everything he did.

One of the most groundbreaking initiatives Benioff introduced was the 1-1-1 model—a pledge to donate 1% of Salesforce's product, equity, and employee time to charitable causes. This wasn't just corporate philanthropy; it was a fundamental shift in how businesses could make a positive impact on society. By empowering employees to give back to their communities, Benioff fostered a sense of purpose and meaning that transcended the bottom line.

But Benioff's vision went beyond charity. He understood that true culture change requires a commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equality. Under his leadership, Salesforce became a trailblazer in the fight for gender equality, achieving pay parity across genders and advocating for equal rights in the workplace.

Benioff's approach to culture change wasn't just about policies and programs—it was about creating a movement. He encouraged employees to be changemakers, to challenge the status quo, and to dream big. And they did. From launching groundbreaking products to pioneering new technologies, Salesforce employees became the driving force behind the company's success.

Today, Salesforce stands as a shining example of what's possible when culture change is embraced wholeheartedly. Under Benioff's leadership, the company has not only achieved unprecedented growth and success but has also become a beacon of hope for a better future. And as other companies look to replicate Salesforce's success, they would do well to remember the words of Marc Benioff: "The business of business is improving the state of the world."

Story of Satya Nadella:
Of course! Let me share with you the captivating story of how Satya Nadella transformed Microsoft into a powerhouse of innovation and inclusion:

It was February 4th, 2014, when Satya Nadella stood before a crowd of employees at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. As the newly appointed CEO, Nadella faced a daunting challenge: to revitalize a tech giant struggling to find its footing in an increasingly competitive landscape.

Nadella understood that culture change was essential for Microsoft's survival. He recognized that the company needed to embrace a growth mindset and foster a culture of innovation and inclusion. With unwavering determination, Nadella set out to reshape Microsoft's identity from the inside out.

Under Nadella's leadership, Microsoft underwent a profound cultural transformation. He prioritized empathy, humility, and diversity, encouraging employees to embrace their unique perspectives and collaborate fearlessly. This shift in mindset paved the way for groundbreaking innovations that would redefine the future of technology.

One of Nadella's most significant contributions to Microsoft's culture was his emphasis on empathy and customer-centricity. He encouraged employees to "walk in the shoes of our customers" and prioritize their needs above all else. This approach led to the development of products like Microsoft Teams and Azure, which quickly became industry leaders in their respective fields.

But Nadella's vision went beyond just creating innovative products; he also recognized the importance of empowering employees to do their best work. Under his leadership, Microsoft embraced a flexible work culture that allowed employees to thrive both professionally and personally. This commitment to work-life balance fostered a sense of trust and loyalty among employees, driving productivity and innovation to new heights.

As the years passed, Nadella's cultural revolution bore fruit. Microsoft's stock price soared, surpassing $1 trillion in market value for the first time in April 2019. But perhaps even more impressive than the financial success was the cultural shift that had taken place within the company.

Today, Microsoft stands as a shining example of what's possible when culture change is embraced wholeheartedly. Under Satya Nadella's leadership, the company has not only reclaimed its status as a tech powerhouse but has also become a beacon of hope for a more inclusive and innovative future. And as other companies look to replicate Microsoft's success, they would do well to remember the transformative power of culture change.
