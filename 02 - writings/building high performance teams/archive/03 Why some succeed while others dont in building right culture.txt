Building culture looks so simple. There are tons of books, example stories. And if i look at any corporate i see that they all are doing what is written in these books. Such as diversity, inclusion, philanthropy etc. All corporates and leaders take these stickers and put it around them. Yet some succeed and other don't. Where is the difference. 

The difference lies in embodying these values in your own life and during tough times and tests. Most leaders pay good lip service to these values but when it comes to making choices they end up choosing what's convenient or what is giving immediate results which are more often than not selfish reasons. 

These values remain at the surfacial levels of beliefs and never convert into faith. When you live these beliefs over and over again and experience the happiness and succeess these end up giving you it then becomes faith. and now a leader is ready to follow these in all adversities. A leader puts interest of others and these values even above immediate business and self results. Leader would fight such battles with investors and even market and even would take dips in the stock price and profitablity knowing that these are going to yield better and bigger results in future. 

This life is a series of tests for all of us and most of us are not able to pass these tests. A successful leader is the one who is able to live upto these values every day and is then able to get similar results from his people. When you are not able to sacrifice a little self interest how do you expect people to leave their lives , their own self interest over the larger purpose ?
