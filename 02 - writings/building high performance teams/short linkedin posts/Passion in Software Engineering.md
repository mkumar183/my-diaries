Passion comes from empathy. Every software is made to help humans do their work easier, quicker and be able to achieve better outcomes. 

When engineers truly understand who are they helping and how their solutions are helping them do their functions then they are fueled by passion of making this reach right audience. 

in a B2B this becomes difficult since engineers have difficulty connecting with those enterprise users. B2C its relatively easy. So B2B software companies, need to provide specific trainings and expose all of their workforce to assume roles of the users of their softwares. 

By knowing what benefit  you are able to cause to your users and understanding their domain engineers become passionate. 

other trigger for passion in engineering is strive for excellence. writing clean code is one example. also going extra mile for quality.
