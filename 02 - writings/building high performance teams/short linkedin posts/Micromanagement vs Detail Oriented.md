What is micromanagement vs what is not ? 

Micromanagement is when manager is interested in things like what time do u come to office. How many bathroom breaks you are taking. Wanting to know more about your personal life. etc. 

A detail oriented manager is concerned with what did you accomplish in last 8 hours of work. Does the work you accomplish justify effort involved. Could you have done more. Managers keeping track of what was done until yesterday and what was done in last 24 hours by each member of the team is not micromanagement. 

Pushing each member for achieving more through efficient methods and achieving more results is not micromanagement.
