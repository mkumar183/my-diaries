We are fearful of death. This fear propels us to do many things in the wrong direction. Fear is bad for the mind and soul as its ingrained in our subconsciousness. Fear will also cause hatred towards things that intimidates us. We will develop many more likes and dislikes based on these fears. Fear as it goes deeper in our subconsciousness can also impact our subsequent lives. 

### Why do we fear death
We fear death because of wrong understanding of our selves. We are in ignorance of delusion. We do not understand the real nature of life. Body, soul and mind. And we think our existence is only for this life. If we knew that after death we are going to get something better would we still be fearful of death. 

### Things to do to eliminate this fear
##### Cultivate right understanding of matter, mind and soul 

#### Know that you may have something better after you give up this body 

#### Instead of fearing death, accept it as reality and rather feel curious towards next journey of your soul. 

#### Understand your attachments and cultivate detachments from these

#### Cultivate love for God and ultimate reality 

#### Know that this life is a step in your journey towards that final goal
