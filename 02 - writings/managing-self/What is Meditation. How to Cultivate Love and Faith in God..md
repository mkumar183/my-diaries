3 Steps to cultivate faith in God. 
1. Develop an understanding of God and spiritual principles. This is process of knowing God. What is God. In this comes understanding of soul vs body vs mind. These are universal truths explained in various spiritual texts and by hundreds or millions of saints if not more. Experiment with these truths scientifically and then come to a conclusion that yes this is what it is. You logically understand it. Still this has not penetrated your heart or higher being. 
	1. Next step of knowing would be getting to know qualities of soul or God. Soul qualities are your innate qualities that are within you. Qualities such as peace, joy, purity of heart, fealessness, honesty, integrity etc. Once you understand these qualities experiment with these. Experiment with happiness and see what leads you to higher level of happiness. 
	2. Know that as you get closer to God / Soul or these soul qualities, you are getting closer to God. With real life experiments solidify these concepts in your conscious brain. 
2. Develop an attraction towards God by knowing people or entities that represent these qualities. Liking towards these qualities of God. Understand as you develop these qualities you are also becoming a more happy and joyous person. 
3. Cultivate Love towards these personalities that represent God like qualities. Dieties or Gurus who are true representation of God. Choose one of these images of God that's closest to you. In my case its my Guru now Paramhamsa Yogananda. He has such precious qualities and i now feel that he is the one who is helping me throughout my journey of life. 
4. From Love transition into Faith so that your every action can reflect this faith now. You will do things that are aligned with these principals and have faith that He is looking at you and for you to take care of you even when things do not look right from worldly perspective.
