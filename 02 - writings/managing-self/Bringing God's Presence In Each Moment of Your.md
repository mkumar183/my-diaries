In my previous article i talked about being in the present moment as key to happiness and fulfillment. Being in the present moment is a habit through which you extract happiness from each moment of your life by avoiding unnecessary thoughts and clutter in your mind. 

In order to build this habit, i also talked about how to divide your moments into different blocks of time and then label these blocks as different contexts that you deal with such as time with self, work, family, friends, travel etc. 

Once you have done this exercise and build a context around each block, now you can start working towards making each of these blocks more and more effective. 

One of the approach to make these blocks of times effective is bringing God's presence in these blocks. Now that your context is different how you apply this principal to each block can differ. Before we delve deeper into this let's understand what does it mean to cultivate habit of 'Ishwara Parinidhana' or God's Presence in your moments. 

When we say word God what rings does it bell to you. What is your meaning and understanding of God. There is an interesting story about God from book : Living with himalayan masters. In this the disciple wants to see God. Now Guru tells him that you can come tomorrow and i will show you God. The disciple is very curious and comes next day morning very excited. But Guru asks him first tell me what is your understanding of God. Whatever it is, i will show you that. 

So God can mean so many things to us. It could be a specific diety (material form representation of God) or some ideals such as honesty, integrity or even something like nature, universe, peace or Joy. Whatever it is, you can work on this habit to improve its presence. 

In my case I am more abstract thinker of God and for me God is one who represents all spiritual qualities such as peace, joy, happiness, honesty, integrity etc. So any person or entity that embodies these values to me is representation of God. In my present state, my Guru very much represent that state so for me to practice presence of God is in form of practicing presence of my Guru. Also, i have to always remind myself that when i mean presence of my Guru i am more concerned about his those qualities such as love, peace, joy etc and not his physical body as such. 

Okay, now that i have explained concept of God lets talk about how to bring it in practice in your different blocks of times. Lets take example of your work block. 

When you are on your work desk, pray to God or your Guru to be present during your work. Pray to Guru to help you concentrate fully without any kind of interruptions in your work. Ask his help to be successful in your work period. It could be knowing what's the highest priority task that you should be working on and then plunging into that task whole heartedly. Also, pray for God that once you plunge into the task help you to forget about its results. You will
