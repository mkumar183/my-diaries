I remember one of the leader i worked with used to say. At times my heart says something and my mind says something. What should i follow ? 

At that time, i did not have answer. But now, i think i do. My answer is follow your heart but use your mind.. Heart defines your leadership while mind defines your managerial skills. 

David said in his video: A leader with bad managerial skills can be a disaster. 

A leader first need to transform themselves in order to become a transformational leader. A transformation leader brings a strong heart to their work and profession. They have a strong desire to help their customers, their employees and investors. This strong desire arises from high compassion. They lead with high empathy with their customers and employees. Through empathy they learn the pain points of their customers and they invoke same compassion in their employees by showing their compassion towards them. In this way a leader that has transformed itself, is able to pass on these qualities into its followers and is able to build a high performing organization. 

While heart is must for a transformation leader, the mind, skills, techniques, methodologies and technical and domain knowledge cannot be undermined. However, my belief is that even if a leader lacks in some of these and is at 70-80% of what an ideal leader would need, the leader can learn and adapt to these easily. 

While spotting a transformation leader, recruiters and hiring manager focus too much on 2nd aspect. They do not pay attention to the first trait and ask questions that reveal that aspect of leaders. And in this way, they miss out on some exceptional leaders in their hunt.
