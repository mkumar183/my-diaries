The **Five Whys** is a problem-solving technique developed by **Taiichi Ohno**, a pioneer of the Toyota Production System. It is a straightforward, iterative method used to explore the root cause of an issue by repeatedly asking the question, **"Why?"** This method helps uncover deeper insights into the problem, ensuring that solutions address the core issue rather than its symptoms.

### **How the Five Whys Work**

1. **Define the Problem**  
    Start with a clear statement of the issue you want to solve.  
    _Example_: "The delivery of a product was late."
    
2. **Ask Why**  
    Ask why the problem occurred and answer based on facts, not guesses.
    
3. **Repeat the Process**  
    Continue asking "Why?" for each subsequent answer, digging deeper with each step. Generally, asking five times is sufficient, though more or fewer iterations may be needed depending on the complexity.

### **Example of the Five Whys**

**Problem**: The delivery of a product was late.

- **1st Why**: Why was the delivery late?  
    _The truck broke down._
- **2nd Why**: Why did the truck break down?  
    _The maintenance schedule was not followed._
- **3rd Why**: Why was the maintenance schedule not followed?  
    _The manager was unaware of the due maintenance._
- **4th Why**: Why was the manager unaware?  
    _There was no automated reminder system._
- **5th Why**: Why is there no automated reminder system?  
    _It was not prioritized during the software upgrade._

**Root Cause**: Lack of prioritization in the software upgrade led to no automated reminders, which caused the maintenance lapse and ultimately the late delivery.

### **Benefits of the Five Whys**

1. **Simplicity**: No special tools are requiredâ€”just focused questioning.
2. **Flexibility**: It can be applied to almost any problem across industries.
3. **Root Cause Focus**: Prevents addressing only superficial symptoms.

### **Tips for Effective Use**

- **Avoid Blame**: Focus on systems and processes, not individuals.
- **Stick to Facts**: Base each "Why?" on verifiable evidence.
- **Collaborate**: Involve relevant team members for diverse perspectives.
