**The True Purpose of Software: Building with Empathy**  

At its heart, software is not just about code or features—it’s a bridge connecting technology to humanity. The true purpose of software is to assist, empower, and enrich the lives of those who use it.  

Exceptional engineers understand this deeply. They don’t just build functionality; they craft experiences. They think about the *who*. Who are the users? In what roles does this software serve them? How does it solve their problems and improve their lives?  

Great engineers take it a step further—they step into the user’s shoes and ask, *“If I were the user, how would I use this software? Does it truly transform my experience?”* This mindset fosters empathy, enabling them to design elegant, intuitive, and impactful solutions.  

When everyone in an organization aligns with this purpose, true innovation emerges. By combining skill with compassion, we can build software that is not only functional but deeply meaningful—a tool that uplifts humanity.  

Build not just for technology. Build for people. Build with empathy.
