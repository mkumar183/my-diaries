1. A high performance team is one that's able to generate value much higher than the investments behind it. When i say 'value' i mean value and not revenue or profits. Value is created via asset generation. Assets are something that give ROI over a long period of time. 
2. A high performance team is autonomous. It runs by itself with minimal guardrails and within its defined domain of impact. 
3. Output of a high performance team is much higher than value its each member could produce and sum together of their values individually. Its larger than sumtotal of its pieces. 
4. Its a happy team. That bonds well together. Understands the business context and is highly sustainable. 
5. Not any single person is indespensable to the team. 
6. Its adaptable to changes in the outer environment and can adjust to variety of changes. Which means it can take different types of work and challenges within similar area of its core expertise. 
7. Its quite technology agnostic. It can work on different technologies. In fact, given a chance this team can also do something outside of its current expertise and be successful just because of its chemistry and bonding together with each other.
