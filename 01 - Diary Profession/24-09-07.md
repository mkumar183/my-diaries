turbulent times in office. i feel attempts being made by Vimal to tarnish my image. he is building attack on work we have done and achievements we had such as:
1. TMA its a small design change but its escalated to Chad's level
2. Idea of running parallel solutions without understanding the problem in depth causing pressure situation
3. Services bringing out may be automation is not working. 

He is bringing out such points instead of really solving any problem. TMA is a small design change which he should be able to execute with the team present in India. 

For automation there is evidence that pulled out 12 engineers from that work and our today's backlog/inflow is doubled and so services might be feeling challenge in handling it. without understanding facts making assumptions. 

as a leader do we know what have been his accomplishments in last 2 years ? i know that his eNPS was lowest. And very few team reported solid line to him. why not give clear responsibilities and ask him to get busy with getting CI transition done and handle it ?
