Red, Green, Refactor, TDD
Red -> write a failing test case. not compiling is failing. 
Green -> write code to make it pass 
Refactor -> look for common patterns , expressions that can be refactored and re-run. 

- Don't write more code than is needed to make a test pass. 
- Don't write more test cases than requirements.
