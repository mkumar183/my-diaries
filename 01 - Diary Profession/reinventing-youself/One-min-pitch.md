**New Simpler Pitch:** 
- Focus on your achievements, successes and few failures (remember at this stage what your teams have achieved is your success.)
- Explain your journey as skills you acquired, successes and failures you had and how you have grown to your current state where you manage a team of 50+ engineers and lead 30-40 personal group to drive change and success for the organization. 
- Highlight your self awareness as your strengths and some of your weaknesses as well if possible. 
- Be humble and show how you have moved from personal success to team and teams success. 


- **A sequence in your professional achievements** as a journey (e.g. as an individual contributor to an engineering manager leading a small team to leading 8-10 teams. Also, technology wise working on Oracle, SQL Based, Backend, ETL engines to Hybrid Applications including Web Applications and Cloud. Transition to agile at Scale and medium scale applications and cloud technologies with DevOps as culture, and other modern techniques such as CICD, Feature Flags, Refactoring large scale applications in smaller chunks, and focus on Observability. Also advent into Architecture understanding microservices as a pattern, AWS Serverless technologies, Dockers and Kubernetes and then confidence in driving teams for building large scale systems. 
- **Current State** I stand more as a generalist than a specialist familiar with overall systems and architectures and able to understand any technology in terms of its role and how it can be benefitial. I also have a good understanding of roles and responsiblities which help me bring right people together to debate, discuss and make sound decisions. My expertise if i want to highlight would be that in hiring where i have good hunch for detecting people with right mix of attitude and aptitude. Also, by bringing my different experiences together i can say i am able to build high performing teams with focus on continuous improvements. 

I am more of a generalist who knows little bit of technology, process, roles, product management, customer satisfaction, functional domain etc..  By bringing these together i like to focus on how teams can perform best. I like to serve and help teams such that they can solve challenges and achieve more. 

I am genuinely interested in learning new things and asking questions esp why are we doing what we are doing ? By logical questioning i am able contextualize best practices. 

Also I like to do the right things even when no one else is doing it or no one is appreciating it. Using this i am proud of what I have built over a period of time in different enterprises. 

I have made mistakes and learned from them. At times, i felt i am quite intelligent and have built systems without taking into account feedback from others. This has taught me a good lesson. Also, today i operate in a more decentralized way where i bring in multiple stakeholders and experts in one place putting more emphasis on going slow but deep considering all angles having more debates and then arrive at solutions and then implement these fast. 

My biggest success and achievement has been in front of hiring. I lead it from front and train everyone in team for ensuring we are getting right talent in reasonable amount of time and cost. My emphasis in hiring is finding a balance between technical understanding and genuine interest in someone to learn new things and also have a caring and sharing attitude. When i find this right blend i make a hiring decision. 

I like to learn new things everyday and i try not to leave any corner unturned in the sense if i come across a new terminology or a new tool or technology i take out little time to read about it and understand and map it with my existing experience. Occassionally, i would take a small training and do some hands on in the technology as well. I do try to keep myself busy some side projects that i will be doing e.g. in my current project i built an automation where jira components are assigned using chatGPT. 

 I am passionate about building high performing teams which to me is to build a structure which is conducive for teams to operate with clarity and independence and then inculcate lean habits in teams for delivery high quality work with minimal waste. 

Habits and behavior that you inculcate in your people and teams is what your biggest addition to these: habits such as: 
- Helping and caring for others and team and organization. 
- Writing clean code is an example of it 
- Focusing on doing the right things taking right decisions 
- Right behavior is spending that another 1 hour on something that will add value and quality to your work even though its not something that's going to be visible easily. 
- A good culture is where people want to help each other and the larger organization. A bad culture is where they want to work for themselves even at the expense of others and the organization. As a leader you set example of this selflessness in  your work and culture and motivate people to do these right things even when no one is watching.
