**New Simpler Pitch:** 
- Focus on your achievements, successes and few failures (remember at this stage what your teams have achieved is your success.)
- Explain your journey as skills you acquired, successes and failures you had and how you have grown to your current state where you manage a team of 50+ engineers and lead 30-40 personal group to drive change and success for the organization. 
- Highlight your curiosity to learn and be very business outcome focus as key strength while your inability to market your solutions and yourself as your weakness. certain amount of shyness and not talking about yourself plus not making problems big rather getting into solving is my nature. plus i believe in continuous improvement which many type of leaders do not appreciate. 

- Be humble and show how you have moved from personal success to team and teams success.

- **A sequence in your professional achievements** as a journey (e.g. as an individual contributor to an engineering manager leading a small team to leading 8-10 teams. Also, technology wise working on Oracle, SQL Based, Backend, ETL engines to Hybrid Applications including Web Applications and Cloud. Transition to agile at Scale and medium scale applications and cloud technologies with DevOps as culture, and other modern techniques such as CICD, Feature Flags, Refactoring large scale applications in smaller chunks, and focus on Observability. Also advent into Architecture understanding microservices as a pattern, AWS Serverless technologies, Dockers and Kubernetes and then confidence in driving teams for building large scale systems. 

- **Current State** I stand more as a generalist than a specialist familiar with overall systems and architectures and able to understand any technology in terms of its role and how it can be benefitial. I also have a good understanding of roles and responsiblities and team dynamics which help me bring right people together to debate, discuss and make sound decisions. My expertise if i want to highlight would be that in by bringing my different experiences together i am very business outcome focused and drive results in a consistent ans sustained manner by keeping my teams excited and motivated via a fair and integral reward and recognition system being very data driven and keeping prejudices out of the system. 

I am more of a generalist who knows little bit of technology, process, roles, product management, customer satisfaction, functional domain etc..  By bringing these together i like to focus on how teams can perform best. I like to serve and help teams such that they can solve challenges and achieve more. 

I am genuinely interested in learning new things and asking questions esp why are we doing what we are doing ? By logical questioning i am able contextualize best practices. 

Also I like to do the right things even when no one else is doing it or no one is appreciating it. Using this i am proud of what I have built over a period of time in different enterprises. 

I have made mistakes and learned from them. At times, i felt i am quite intelligent and have built systems without taking into account feedback from others. This has taught me a good lesson. Also, today i operate in a more decentralized way where i bring in multiple stakeholders and experts in one place putting more emphasis on going slow but deep considering all angles having more debates and then arrive at solutions and then implement these fast. 

My biggest success and achievement has been in front of hiring. I lead it from front and train everyone in team for ensuring we are getting right talent in reasonable amount of time and cost. My emphasis in hiring is finding a balance between technical understanding and genuine interest in someone to learn new things and also have a caring and sharing attitude. When i find this right blend i make a hiring decision. 

I like to learn new things everyday and i try not to leave any corner unturned in the sense if i come across a new terminology or a new tool or technology i take out little time to read about it and understand and map it with my existing experience. Occassionally, i would take a small training and do some hands on in the technology as well. I do try to keep myself busy some side projects that i will be doing e.g. in my current project i built an automation where jira components are assigned using chatGPT. 

 I am passionate about building high performing teams which to me is to build a structure which is conducive for teams to operate with clarity and independence and then inculcate lean habits in teams for delivery high quality work with minimal waste. 

Habits and behavior that you inculcate in your people and teams is what your biggest addition to these: habits such as: 
- Helping and caring for others and team and organization. 
- Writing clean code is an example of it 
- Focusing on doing the right things taking right decisions 
- Right behavior is spending that another 1 hour on something that will add value and quality to your work even though its not something that's going to be visible easily. 
- A good culture is where people want to help each other and the larger organization. A bad culture is where they want to work for themselves even at the expense of others and the organization. As a leader you set example of this selflessness in  your work and culture and motivate people to do these right things even when no one is watching. 


Talk about your passion for building teams with great culture. What you experienced at Oracle Projects. How your manager treated you well and you all are life long friends even today. 


How you observed that culture has taken a big hit. Also, Agile and rapid changes in technology and processes disrupted the whole industry in a big way. The world at large could not handle this change and expansion. And then i found in multiple places not so nice culture. And teams struggling with big sizes etc. 

So i had lots of questions how things are done with modern tools and methods. Then, i came across companies like thought-works, spotify, netflix and then schoology. At schoology, i experienced the culture and their way of working. I experienced true agile, methods of estimations, managing with data real metrics. Also, a culture of continuous learning. While i was building the teams i learned and grasped this culture as well as covid gave me good amount of time to learn and re-learn many technologies. 

Another dimension where i worked during all these times has been my practice of meditation and teachings of yss. These teachings plus meditation has been transformational in the sense it has provided me extra ordinary clarity of mind. It has answered my questions. Deepest of these is the purpose of life and being able to achieve it through your duties in the world. Not working for outward success but for inward success. 

By bringing all these together, i think today i am positioned to be a great transformational leader. I have proven methods and approaches. There may be certain areas where i may lack but overall i am positioned to be a great success. My time has come is something like that i feel about myself and so i am so ready for this role and position. 

I think long term. I think value creation. Those are fun things to me. I am not a margin person. I don't think about short term margins. Though i understand contextual importance of it. I believe in doing things that will continue to multiply value years over years and one day it will become visible. That's my ingrained thought process. Very high on patience. Like to play long term games. 


Key Strengths: 
1. Humility
2. Learning Attitude. 
3. Value and Investment Mindset. Big Thinking Mindset. Strategic thinking. Impractical, Idealism, Perfectionist, Not so Tactical. 
4. Individual approach vs Team Approach. Most people fail in execution because they think of people as individual and are not able to visualize and arrange them in form of teams. Teams are small communities that bring happiness to them. They want to work together. Their outputs are much higher than individual person. 
5. A thought leader.
