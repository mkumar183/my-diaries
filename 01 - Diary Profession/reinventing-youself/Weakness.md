Anything that has lead you to failures. 
- I am a humble person and also very focused on solving problems. 
	- Once i identify a problem i get busy in solving the problem. However, once the problem is solved, I am not selling the solution too much. I show case the success and then move on quickly. I see leaders forget these successes and achievements and I do not get enough credit and visibility for the same. I have very high potential however, i feel this potential does not come so much in limelight while other peers are constantly hammering on their challenges and problems. 
- My plan to improve upon it is that I will show case the problems and run these problems with multiple people multiple times. Once team solves the problems i will take out time to talk about the solution in multiple forums. I will create venues for the team to talk about these solutions until everyone knows about these solutions.
