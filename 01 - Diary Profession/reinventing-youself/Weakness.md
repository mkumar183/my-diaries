Anything that has lead you to failures. 
- Not Shrewd. Too straight forward. 
	- Relationships with Product. 
	- Not able to create impression on Top Management 
- too humble. and i get downed for my work since i focus on doing work than showing it. Not good at Building my self image and selling myself 
	- I have focused more on how and not on what to achieve.
- i like doing strategic thinking and setting medium term goals. set habits. i am not great fire fighter nor do i believe in building fires and quenching it. i am bery proactive. i would see things coming months in advance.
