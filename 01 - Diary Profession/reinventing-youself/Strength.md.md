- humbleness and ability to collaborate and get best out of people esp when they are far better than me. i am not intimidated by then yet i treat them with respect. i am able to ask deeper questions and penetrate into something thats real. also, my approach is very practical and simple. i don't believe in anything complex. i like to kill complexities from systems. 
The above skills impart me unique ability to Zoom in and Zoom out and ask questions from various angles. Bringing these skills in various dimensions together I am able to build high performance team
