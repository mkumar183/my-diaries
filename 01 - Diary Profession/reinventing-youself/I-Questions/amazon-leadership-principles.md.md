**Bias For Action (Get things Done!)** 
**Making a decision with limited Information**
- Building an automation utility for Signature mapping and Assessment upload that ended up freeing 10+ engineers from service low value work 
- Using GenAI for Defect classification and using it for analysing past information to reduce inflow of bugs across project 
- Taking up Snowflake Migration project in control of India Team by setting up a team of Interns. Identifying a leader from existing staff and guiding / coaching this staff. I also committed a deadline to our CTO for this based on a gut feel. 
- Implement Serverless Architecture for Kickboard. (My manager said, you will make mistakes but you will learn. so long as you own these you are free.)

**Invent and Simplify (Lead teams that Innovate and invent)**
- Tenant Manager application ownership in India. 
- Implementing AWS Batch for Reporting Solution for one of the product. 
- Signature Automation Work 
- SIS Sync utility - using AWS Batch rather than Lambda, API Gateway and Step Functions 
- Avoided kickboard integration into TM 

Have Backbone (Challenge and Commit)
- Use of Talend and PowerBI for Architecture (I wanted to use plain python and hand built dashboards as primary solution with PowerBI for ad-hoc reporting)
- On several EPICs and User Stories e.g. use of Custom Widgets in PowerBI. Asking questions as to what does customer really want to see and how can we achieve this. Final decisions are with Product Owner but i challenge them on several instances. 
- Snowflake Migration
- Back to Office: How you got your staff together and make them understand and slowly pull them all back to office. 
- PowerScore - Build a utility to get data by each sprint. Coached teams how to leverage and how to utilize it 

Earn Trust / Challenge and commit
- AI initiative : partnerships than build
- MFE - over doing 
- Backbone for my India Leader 
- No Gossip policy 
- Dumb question incidence 
- Sales challenge and leg pulling 
- Interviews - ppl wanting to join if they have spoken to me. 

Are Right A lot
- Assessment signature
- Team restructure 
- Component wise analysis 
- Feature flags / Branching strategy
- Serverless and Aws batch 
- Building internal system for tracking 
- Intuition in many technical solutions (jobs not scaling - add more queues. Horizontal vs vertical SQL and BD related problems. Where would the problem be most likely. )
- Rearch of allocation module 
- Using View based Approach in Oracle Fusion 
- Haiku Learning 

Hire and develop best
- Madan, Sriman, Nagarjuna, Srini Swaminathan, Zenoti Team, 

Frugality
- openlens, mac to windows, unnecessary licenses, cloud coat, 
- Cautious on hiring. Donâ€™t believe in top talent but cant compromise on attitude, communication and basic minimum skills. 

Think Big

- Think of each of our product as a microservice. 
- Building centralized sync 

Ownership
- Kickboard, Haiku Learning 
- Tenant Manager, Team accountability (component wise)
- Full ownership of EPICs, POD scaling, MTSS 

Deep Dive
