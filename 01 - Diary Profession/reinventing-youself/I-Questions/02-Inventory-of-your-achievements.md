**And Actions:**
1. Separated out people working on signature work. Started its automation. Built a project and created requirements such that all inputs can be entered into an excel sheet and then the program can generated signatures and connectors. Reverse engineering project. 
2. Analysed team backlog. Categorize these into components. Moved from technical component to module wise components. And proposed a team structure based on functional module ownership.
3. Identified non-productive work by connecting jira tickets with git and revealed that a large chunk of work was unproductive in team. Its repetitive and there are no RCA or long term fixes being put up. KPI like capex vs opex work. How much time teams are spending on bug fixes vs new feature development and work upon reducing the effort being spent on bug fixes. 
4. Cross-trained teams on their respective modules. Connectors, ETLs and Dashboards. Enabled each team to be able to handle all issues in their respective modules. Leading to reduced cycle times for these issues. And also quick assignment of these issues.
