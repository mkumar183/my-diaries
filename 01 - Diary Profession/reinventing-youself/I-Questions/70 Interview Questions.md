No big failures.

- Zenoti: I built a product part of which many stakeholders did not like. We replaced that with Tablue. Learning: In the earlier phases get enough validations from sales and other stakeholders. Do what you think is right however, take all feedback early on and if posssible have some written trails of these. 
Today i am not afraid of making mistakes however, i make many smaller mistakes at earlier phases of their lifecycle to avoid big and last minute failures. I encourage my teams making mistakes but earlier in their cycles. That way, by the end very little scope for a big mistake.
