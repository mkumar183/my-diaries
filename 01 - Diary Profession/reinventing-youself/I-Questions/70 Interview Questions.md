PowerSchool: Its no more on growth path. Growth is sluggish. Change of hands and management is imminent. 

8. Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned from it.
- Early in my career i almost broke a robot. It was very expensive then. After this incident I became over careful about testing. Esp. divide by zero.
- TekSystems: The project was too big for me. 60-70 engineers. There was no structure of work. My knowledge of automation was limited. I struggled through that project and those clients. 
- Zenoti: I built a product part of which many stakeholders did not like. We replaced that with Tablue. Learning: In the earlier phases get enough validations from sales and other stakeholders. Do what you think is right however, take all feedback early on and if posssible have some written trails of these. 
Today i am not afraid of making mistakes however, i make many smaller mistakes at earlier phases of their lifecycle to avoid big and last minute failures. I encourage my teams making mistakes but earlier in their cycles. That way, by the end very little scope for a big mistake. I belive in iterations and getting early on customer and other stakeholders feedback rather than building for months and then exposing the system.
