From Meta, MS, LinkedIn, SF. 

Why are they acquiring me ? What they want to do with it ? 

**World**
Major thought behind, how would the world benefit overall from this merger. What are the key synergy. Where is more value generation. 

**Customers and Users**
Are there existing users of both systems that will benefit from this acquisition. 

**Employees**
What are the values of company acquiring me. How would my employee feel part of them. Would they be valued in same. How would they undergo cultural transition in case underlying values of two companies are different. How would they benefit from this acquisition.
