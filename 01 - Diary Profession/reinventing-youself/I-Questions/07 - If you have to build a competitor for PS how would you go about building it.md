- Who am I ? Am I an individual or a VC ? How much money do i have to start with ? Why i want to compete with PS ? Do i have to start from scratch or do i have a VC funding to acquire another company and do it. 

- My underlying thought process would not be to compete with PS, rather it would be customers who are not getting the right service, how can i get them better service and better products. For that i would analyze weak spot of PowerSchool. An area where it either does not have presence or its doing a poor service e.g. it could be ERP which is the weakest spot. 


- Now that my target customers are identified, i would look for a solution through which i can get entry into these customers however small. An example here would be a competitor who built plugins for our districts. 

- I will build integration with its most competing options such as Schoology or Performance Matters which i don't think i can build easily. However, i would integrate in such a way that i overcome the biggest hurdle it has which is data integration.
