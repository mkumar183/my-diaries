- I don't think i have been able to present the challenges i have handled and how i have gone above and beyond my responsibilities i have been able to convey to my leadership. This has led me to frustrations at several stages. However, i have continued to do what is right. 

- Focusing on Big Impact items. Whatever i was doing it was perceived as focusing on very little little things. They did not see the big picture behind it or may be it was me who did not explain it enough. However, when things came together they complemented me that oh we did not think that this 


- I think i have failed at ability to explain rational behind some of the decisions i have taken. I somehow believe in doing the right things and when things made most sense to me with nearest stakeholders i went ahead with those decisions. However, later i found that there were stakeholders that did not align with those decisions. In fact, there was some office politics and i was rather given negative result of those decisions. At Zenoti we decided to build our own framework for reporting. Later, It was presented that its too expensive and a solution like Tableau will serve better with immediate pressing needs. 


- Likewise at Zenoti we decided to build a new Accounting Framework. I presented the design and approach. However, at a later point of time we had to revert this back because existing system was already using an accounting methodologies which was not ideal however, that was being used by customers and we could not have had even a single cent difference in numbers across two systems.


- I still believe in doing the right things, I do not care so much about rewards and recognition however, I have learned one thing. That every decision we make and agree is there in writing somewhere. So that we all can refer back to it and if it needs to undergo a change all those people have to come back and review it. Also, I do not take unilateral decisions. I bring multiple people together and have right collaboration when we are taking a decision that's going to be multi month and a larger impact.
