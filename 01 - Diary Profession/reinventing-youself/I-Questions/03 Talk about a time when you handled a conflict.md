Skill to handle conflicts and communication skills.

Acting is must. Monitor the situation for a time. Once its over , talk to team members to reaffirm that conflict is over. 

1. Conflict with QA 
	Situation: For One team concern was raised that QA is taking too much time and its resulting in spill over.  
	Task: Called a meeting involving QA Manager and QA Director. And heard both the parties. 
	Action: Make some adjustments in the process. Many tickets could be marked as QA Exempt. Total Ownership is with team. QA to focus more on Automation. 
	Result: Team is able to move tickets fast. There is better work life balance for QA and Devs and all are happy. They understand pain points of each other. It took some time and not easy but with repeated message this could be done. 

1. Conflict with Cloudops Team. 
	Situation: Team was complaining about cloudops. One team member wrote in a private group that CloudOps is asking Dumb Question. 
	Task: I replied immediately, that i do not agree with this word. There are no quesions that are dumb. 
	Action: Formalize cloudops to engineering communication. Log FS Tickets for issues that you face and ask cloudops to log jira tickets. Analyze these tickets to identify communication and knowledge gaps. 
	Result: We now have a process where both teams are accountable and there is a monthly retrospection on these tickets and actions are taken to improve communication and handling of assets. 


3. Conflict with Product Management 
Situation: I sensed that there is one PO who is trying to arm-wrestle the team members. 
Task: I have a 1-1 with VP of product. I brought up this issue and concern to him. Initially, he did not agree with me. 
Action: I also had a 1-1 with specific product owner and i explained to him that i have heard these issues. I also conveyed these concerns to my counter part. He insisted on me providing some specifics. Why we are here to work as One Team One Heart. And I am not here to anyone disrepecting others. I also take whole team on outing every 6 months and i observe their behaviours how are they interacting. I included cloudops/qa and product in these outings. 
Result: Team is very well aligned with each other and there are no major conflicts among team members.
