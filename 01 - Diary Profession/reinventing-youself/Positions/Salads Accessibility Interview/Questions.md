### As we integrate more AI into content accessibility, where do you see the balance between technological solutions and human intervention?
Yes certainly ! I think at least as of today human intervention is needed to review what is generated by AI. However, the effort required is greatly reduced to 20% of what it would be required without AI. So there is a great saving of effort. However, specific expert with specific context still need to review subtitles, transcripts, descriptions generated by AI. 

### Are there specific areas within video accessibility where AI cannot fully replace humans?
Final Review of these generated texts is where human is still needed. A human expert who has experience for specific needs is still required to validate and review. AI should always be used as an assistant to these humans who have been helping and creating such content. 

However, at times for massive amount of Video that is create today on platforms, it may not be possible to have humans monitor and create accessibility related artifacts and such content can be automated. 

### What are the typical costs associated with making video content globally accessible?
### Are these solutions financially viable for all media companies, from startups to public companies?
If your content is for global audience then costs associated with making video content globally accessible is not more than the benefits companies will reap. 1 out of every 6 person. Globally 1.2 people needing is a big number. Also, this number becomes larger when we look at B2B and ecosystems which only accept content with full accessibility. To me, having all content fully accessible is a very high competitive advantage that companies can thrive on. In case these processes are built in from left side of the cycle then costs are not huge i think with less than 5% additional investment this can be achieved. 

### How does enhancing accessibility affect a companies bottom line?
### Can you provide examples where improved accessibility has led to noticeable gains in revenue or brand recognition?
In case companies are including accessibility part of their culture and process then i do not think the cost is high. Its like taking care of any other nuance that has to be taken care. Since these processes are highly automatable and can be incorporated into the platforms itself I don't think it really impacts the bottom line. 

There would be an impact on bottom line one time for establishing the processes and guidelines though. And also, in case companies do that after the fact. On right side of their supply chain then it would come out as additional cost. 

Given that fact that 1 out of every 6 person needs this and all B2B companies require this as a compliance, i can say most organizations benefit from these methods and they can easily broaden their customer base across the globe easily. XBOX and Microsoft is a good example where most of their products are incorporating these features from early lifecycle and have gained good traction in the market because of this. 

Think of a family which is buying XBOX vs its competition. If any family requires any such feature, this would become a natural choice for them to select it over other products. And in a way it will end up winning the game. So to me, this is a very strategic game changer strategy for companies to adopt. Factors like Empathy also play a big role in your public image as a company and there is a large percentage of population who is emotionally connected with such products and companies who care about everyone and high inclusivity. So yes, there are significant gains associated with this.
