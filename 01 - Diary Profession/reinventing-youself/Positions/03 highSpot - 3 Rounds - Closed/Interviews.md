Jeremy
- Introduce Yourself - Engineer at heart and have grown from there. 
- Since you said you are engineer, how do you handle managers, Sr Managers and still get time to think strategic and zoom in/zoom out of technical problems : 
	- I talked about how i use career ladder to define roles and set goals and personal targets. 
	- I talked about shared service in team how i coach engineers to think beyond their roles and have a team of managers to handle different things. 
	- My approach is very de-centralized 
- Role of QA: It was eliminated and how would you handle teams with no or very less QA. What's role of QA in your mind. 
	- I answered that team accountability for testing. QA role is more for ensuring E2E is up-to-date and any regressions are caught through it. Developers can develop and ship code fast. 
	- He said are you recommending test-driven approach, i said not necessarily, there are situations where you don't want to invest right away in those tests however, when you know you are going to come back to the code again and again to change it then better put it behind those guardrails that minimize your efforts for re-testing. 
- Why you want to join highSpot:
